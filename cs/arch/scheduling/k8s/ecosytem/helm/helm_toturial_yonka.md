## template

```
{{/* a comment */}}
{{- /* a comment with white space trimmed from preceding and following text */ -}}
	A comment; discarded. May contain newlines.
	Comments do not nest and must start and end at the
	delimiters, as shown here.

{{pipeline}}
	The default textual representation (the same as would be
	printed by fmt.Print) of the value of the pipeline is copied
	to the output.

{{if pipeline}} T1 {{end}}
	If the value of the pipeline is empty, no output is generated;
	otherwise, T1 is executed. The empty values are false, 0, any
	nil pointer or interface value, and any array, slice, map, or
	string of length zero.
	Dot is unaffected.

{{if pipeline}} T1 {{else}} T0 {{end}}
	If the value of the pipeline is empty, T0 is executed;
	otherwise, T1 is executed. Dot is unaffected.

{{if pipeline}} T1 {{else if pipeline}} T0 {{end}}
	To simplify the appearance of if-else chains, the else action
	of an if may include another if directly; the effect is exactly
	the same as writing
		{{if pipeline}} T1 {{else}}{{if pipeline}} T0 {{end}}{{end}}

{{range pipeline}} T1 {{end}}
	The value of the pipeline must be an array, slice, map, or channel.
	If the value of the pipeline has length zero, nothing is output;
	otherwise, dot is set to the successive elements of the array,
	slice, or map and T1 is executed. If the value is a map and the
	keys are of basic type with a defined order, the elements will be
	visited in sorted key order.

{{range pipeline}} T1 {{else}} T0 {{end}}
	The value of the pipeline must be an array, slice, map, or channel.
	If the value of the pipeline has length zero, dot is unaffected and
	T0 is executed; otherwise, dot is set to the successive elements
	of the array, slice, or map and T1 is executed.

{{template "name"}}
	The template with the specified name is executed with nil data.

{{template "name" pipeline}}
	The template with the specified name is executed with dot set
	to the value of the pipeline.

{{block "name" pipeline}} T1 {{end}}
	A block is shorthand for defining a template
		{{define "name"}} T1 {{end}}
	and then executing it in place
		{{template "name" pipeline}}
	The typical use is to define a set of root templates that are
	then customized by redefining the block templates within.

{{with pipeline}} T1 {{end}}
	If the value of the pipeline is empty, no output is generated;
	otherwise, dot is set to the value of the pipeline and T1 is
	executed.

{{with pipeline}} T1 {{else}} T0 {{end}}
	If the value of the pipeline is empty, dot is unaffected and T0
	is executed; otherwise, dot is set to the value of the pipeline
	and T1 is executed.

### if

似乎没办法判空和判nil？
比如显式传入空字符串、空列表，没办法区分？
