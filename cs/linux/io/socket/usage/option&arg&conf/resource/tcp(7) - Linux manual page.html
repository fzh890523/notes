<h2><a id="DESCRIPTION" href="#DESCRIPTION"></a>DESCRIPTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       This is an implementation of the TCP protocol defined in RFC 793,
       RFC 1122 and RFC 2001 with the NewReno and SACK extensions.  It
       provides a reliable, stream-oriented, full-duplex connection between
       two sockets on top of <a href="../man7/ip.7.html">ip(7)</a>, for both v4 and v6 versions.  TCP
       guarantees that the data arrives in order and retransmits lost
       packets.  It generates and checks a per-packet checksum to catch
       transmission errors.  TCP does not preserve record boundaries.

       A newly created TCP socket has no remote or local address and is not
       fully specified.  To create an outgoing TCP connection use <a href="../man2/connect.2.html">connect(2)</a>
       to establish a connection to another TCP socket.  To receive new
       incoming connections, first <a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind(2)</a> the socket to a local address and
       port and then call <a href="../man2/listen.2.html">listen(2)</a> to put the socket into the listening
       state.  After that a new socket for each incoming connection can be
       accepted using <a href="../man2/accept.2.html">accept(2)</a>.  A socket which has had <a href="../man2/accept.2.html">accept(2)</a> or
       <a href="../man2/connect.2.html">connect(2)</a> successfully called on it is fully specified and may
       transmit data.  Data cannot be transmitted on listening or not yet
       connected sockets.

       Linux supports RFC 1323 TCP high performance extensions.  These
       include Protection Against Wrapped Sequence Numbers (PAWS), Window
       Scaling and Timestamps.  Window scaling allows the use of large (&gt;
       64K) TCP windows in order to support links with high latency or
       bandwidth.  To make use of them, the send and receive buffer sizes
       must be increased.  They can be set globally with the
       <i>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_wmem</i> and <i>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem</i> files, or
       on individual sockets by using the <b>SO_SNDBUF </b>and <b>SO_RCVBUF </b>socket
       options with the <a href="../man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt(2)</a> call.

       The maximum sizes for socket buffers declared via the <b>SO_SNDBUF </b>and
       <b>SO_RCVBUF </b>mechanisms are limited by the values in the
       <i>/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max</i> and <i>/proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max</i> files.
       Note that TCP actually allocates twice the size of the buffer
       requested in the <a href="../man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt(2)</a> call, and so a succeeding
       <a href="../man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt(2)</a> call will not return the same size of buffer as
       requested in the <a href="../man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt(2)</a> call.  TCP uses the extra space for
       administrative purposes and internal kernel structures, and the <i>/proc</i>
       file values reflect the larger sizes compared to the actual TCP
       windows.  On individual connections, the socket buffer size must be
       set prior to the <a href="../man2/listen.2.html">listen(2)</a> or <a href="../man2/connect.2.html">connect(2)</a> calls in order to have it
       take effect.  See <a href="../man7/socket.7.html">socket(7)</a> for more information.

       TCP supports urgent data.  Urgent data is used to signal the receiver
       that some important message is part of the data stream and that it
       should be processed as soon as possible.  To send urgent data specify
       the <b>MSG_OOB </b>option to <a href="../man2/send.2.html">send(2)</a>.  When urgent data is received, the
       kernel sends a <b>SIGURG </b>signal to the process or process group that has
       been set as the socket "owner" using the <b>SIOCSPGRP </b>or <b>FIOSETOWN</b>
       ioctls (or the POSIX.1-specified <a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a> <b>F_SETOWN </b>operation).  When
       the <b>SO_OOBINLINE </b>socket option is enabled, urgent data is put into
       the normal data stream (a program can test for its location using the
       <b>SIOCATMARK </b>ioctl described below), otherwise it can be received only
       when the <b>MSG_OOB </b>flag is set for <a href="../man2/recv.2.html">recv(2)</a> or <a href="../man2/recvmsg.2.html">recvmsg(2)</a>.

       When out-of-band data is present, <a href="../man2/select.2.html">select(2)</a> indicates the file
       descriptor as having an exceptional condition and <a href="../man2/poll.2.html">poll(2)</a> indicates a
       <b>POLLPRI </b>event.

       Linux 2.4 introduced a number of changes for improved throughput and
       scaling, as well as enhanced functionality.  Some of these features
       include support for zero-copy <a href="../man2/sendfile.2.html">sendfile(2)</a>, Explicit Congestion
       Notification, new management of TIME_WAIT sockets, keep-alive socket
       options and support for Duplicate SACK extensions.

   <b>Address formats</b>
       TCP is built on top of IP (see <a href="../man7/ip.7.html">ip(7)</a>).  The address formats defined
       by <a href="../man7/ip.7.html">ip(7)</a> apply to TCP.  TCP supports point-to-point communication
       only; broadcasting and multicasting are not supported.

   <b>/proc interfaces</b>
       System-wide TCP parameter settings can be accessed by files in the
       directory <i>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/</i>.  In addition, most IP <i>/proc</i> interfaces
       also apply to TCP; see <a href="../man7/ip.7.html">ip(7)</a>.  Variables described as <i>Boolean</i> take an
       integer value, with a nonzero value ("true") meaning that the
       corresponding option is enabled, and a zero value ("false") meaning
       that the option is disabled.

       <i>tcp_abc</i> (Integer; default: 0; Linux 2.6.15 to Linux 3.8)
              Control the Appropriate Byte Count (ABC), defined in RFC 3465.
              ABC is a way of increasing the congestion window (<i>cwnd</i>) more
              slowly in response to partial acknowledgments.  Possible
              values are:

              0  increase <i>cwnd</i> once per acknowledgment (no ABC)

              1  increase <i>cwnd</i> once per acknowledgment of full sized segment

              2  allow increase <i>cwnd</i> by two if acknowledgment is of two
                 segments to compensate for delayed acknowledgments.

       <i>tcp_abort_on_overflow</i> (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux 2.4)
              Enable resetting connections if the listening service is too
              slow and unable to keep up and accept them.  It means that if
              overflow occurred due to a burst, the connection will recover.
              Enable this option <i>only</i> if you are really sure that the
              listening daemon cannot be tuned to accept connections faster.
              Enabling this option can harm the clients of your server.

       <i>tcp_adv_win_scale</i> (integer; default: 2; since Linux 2.4)
              Count buffering overhead as <i>bytes/2^tcp_adv_win_scale</i>, if
              <i>tcp_adv_win_scale</i> is greater than 0; or <i>bytes-</i>
              <i>bytes/2^(-tcp_adv_win_scale)</i>, if <i>tcp_adv_win_scale</i> is less
              than or equal to zero.

              The socket receive buffer space is shared between the
              application and kernel.  TCP maintains part of the buffer as
              the TCP window, this is the size of the receive window
              advertised to the other end.  The rest of the space is used as
              the "application" buffer, used to isolate the network from
              scheduling and application latencies.  The <i>tcp_adv_win_scale</i>
              default value of 2 implies that the space used for the
              application buffer is one fourth that of the total.

       <i>tcp_allowed_congestion_control</i> (String; default: see text; since
       Linux 2.4.20)
              Show/set the congestion control algorithm choices available to
              unprivileged processes (see the description of the
              <b>TCP_CONGESTION </b>socket option).  The items in the list are
              separated by white space and terminated by a newline
              character.  The list is a subset of those listed in
              <i>tcp_available_congestion_control</i>.  The default value for this
              list is "reno" plus the default setting of
              <i>tcp_congestion_control</i>.

       <i>tcp_autocorking</i> (Boolean; default: enabled; since Linux 3.14)
              If this option is enabled, the kernel tries to coalesce small
              writes (from consecutive <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a> and <a href="../man2/sendmsg.2.html">sendmsg(2)</a> calls) as
              much as possible, in order to decrease the total number of
              sent packets.  Coalescing is done if at least one prior packet
              for the flow is waiting in Qdisc queues or device transmit
              queue.  Applications can still use the <b>TCP_CORK </b>socket option
              to obtain optimal behavior when they know how/when to uncork
              their sockets.

       <i>tcp_available_congestion_control</i> (String; read-only; since Linux
       2.4.20)
              Show a list of the congestion-control algorithms that are
              registered.  The items in the list are separated by white
              space and terminated by a newline character.  This list is a
              limiting set for the list in <i>tcp_allowed_congestion_control</i>.
              More congestion-control algorithms may be available as
              modules, but not loaded.

       <i>tcp_app_win</i> (integer; default: 31; since Linux 2.4)
              This variable defines how many bytes of the TCP window are
              reserved for buffering overhead.

              A maximum of (<i>window/2^tcp_app_win</i>, mss) bytes in the window
              are reserved for the application buffer.  A value of 0 implies
              that no amount is reserved.

       <i>tcp_base_mss</i> (Integer; default: 512; since Linux 2.6.17)
              The initial value of <i>search_low</i> to be used by the
              packetization layer Path MTU discovery (MTU probing).  If MTU
              probing is enabled, this is the initial MSS used by the
              connection.

       <i>tcp_bic</i> (Boolean; default: disabled; Linux 2.4.27/2.6.6 to 2.6.13)
              Enable BIC TCP congestion control algorithm.  BIC-TCP is a
              sender-side-only change that ensures a linear RTT fairness
              under large windows while offering both scalability and
              bounded TCP-friendliness.  The protocol combines two schemes
              called additive increase and binary search increase.  When the
              congestion window is large, additive increase with a large
              increment ensures linear RTT fairness as well as good
              scalability.  Under small congestion windows, binary search
              increase provides TCP friendliness.

       <i>tcp_bic_low_window</i> (integer; default: 14; Linux 2.4.27/2.6.6 to
       2.6.13)
              Set the threshold window (in packets) where BIC TCP starts to
              adjust the congestion window.  Below this threshold BIC TCP
              behaves the same as the default TCP Reno.

       <i>tcp_bic_fast_convergence</i> (Boolean; default: enabled; Linux
       2.4.27/2.6.6 to 2.6.13)
              Force BIC TCP to more quickly respond to changes in congestion
              window.  Allows two flows sharing the same connection to
              converge more rapidly.

       <i>tcp_congestion_control</i> (String; default: see text; since Linux
       2.4.13)
              Set the default congestion-control algorithm to be used for
              new connections.  The algorithm "reno" is always available,
              but additional choices may be available depending on kernel
              configuration.  The default value for this file is set as part
              of kernel configuration.

       <i>tcp_dma_copybreak</i> (integer; default: 4096; since Linux 2.6.24)
              Lower limit, in bytes, of the size of socket reads that will
              be offloaded to a DMA copy engine, if one is present in the
              system and the kernel was configured with the <b>CONFIG_NET_DMA</b>
              option.

       <i>tcp_dsack</i> (Boolean; default: enabled; since Linux 2.4)
              Enable RFC 2883 TCP Duplicate SACK support.

       <i>tcp_ecn</i> (Integer; default: see below; since Linux 2.4)
              Enable RFC 3168 Explicit Congestion Notification.

              This file can have one of the following values:

              0      Disable ECN.  Neither initiate nor accept ECN.  This
                     was the default up to and including Linux 2.6.30.

              1      Enable ECN when requested by incoming connections and
                     also request ECN on outgoing connection attempts.

              2      Enable ECN when requested by incoming connections, but
                     do not request ECN on outgoing connections.  This value
                     is supported, and is the default, since Linux 2.6.31.

              When enabled, connectivity to some destinations could be
              affected due to older, misbehaving middle boxes along the
              path, causing connections to be dropped.  However, to
              facilitate and encourage deployment with option 1, and to work
              around such buggy equipment, the <b>tcp_ecn_fallback </b>option has
              been introduced.

       <i>tcp_ecn_fallback</i> (Boolean; default: enabled; since Linux 4.1)
              Enable RFC 3168, Section 6.1.1.1. fallback.  When enabled,
              outgoing ECN-setup SYNs that time out within the normal SYN
              retransmission timeout will be resent with CWR and ECE
              cleared.

       <i>tcp_fack</i> (Boolean; default: enabled; since Linux 2.2)
              Enable TCP Forward Acknowledgement support.

       <i>tcp_fin_timeout</i> (integer; default: 60; since Linux 2.2)
              This specifies how many seconds to wait for a final FIN packet
              before the socket is forcibly closed.  This is strictly a
              violation of the TCP specification, but required to prevent
              denial-of-service attacks.  In Linux 2.2, the default value
              was 180.

       <i>tcp_frto</i> (integer; default: see below; since Linux 2.4.21/2.6)
              Enable F-RTO, an enhanced recovery algorithm for TCP
              retransmission timeouts (RTOs).  It is particularly beneficial
              in wireless environments where packet loss is typically due to
              random radio interference rather than intermediate router
              congestion.  See RFC 4138 for more details.

              This file can have one of the following values:

              0  Disabled.  This was the default up to and including Linux
                 2.6.23.

              1  The basic version F-RTO algorithm is enabled.

              2  Enable SACK-enhanced F-RTO if flow uses SACK.  The basic
                 version can be used also when SACK is in use though in that
                 case scenario(s) exists where F-RTO interacts badly with
                 the packet counting of the SACK-enabled TCP flow.  This
                 value is the default since Linux 2.6.24.

              Before Linux 2.6.22, this parameter was a Boolean value,
              supporting just values 0 and 1 above.

       <i>tcp_frto_response</i> (integer; default: 0; since Linux 2.6.22)
              When F-RTO has detected that a TCP retransmission timeout was
              spurious (i.e., the timeout would have been avoided had TCP
              set a longer retransmission timeout), TCP has several options
              concerning what to do next.  Possible values are:

              0  Rate halving based; a smooth and conservative response,
                 results in halved congestion window (<i>cwnd</i>) and slow-start
                 threshold (<i>ssthresh</i>) after one RTT.

              1  Very conservative response; not recommended because even
                 though being valid, it interacts poorly with the rest of
                 Linux TCP; halves <i>cwnd</i> and <i>ssthresh</i> immediately.

              2  Aggressive response; undoes congestion-control measures
                 that are now known to be unnecessary (ignoring the
                 possibility of a lost retransmission that would require TCP
                 to be more cautious); <i>cwnd</i> and <i>ssthresh</i> are restored to the
                 values prior to timeout.

       <i>tcp_keepalive_intvl</i> (integer; default: 75; since Linux 2.4)
              The number of seconds between TCP keep-alive probes.

       <i>tcp_keepalive_probes</i> (integer; default: 9; since Linux 2.2)
              The maximum number of TCP keep-alive probes to send before
              giving up and killing the connection if no response is
              obtained from the other end.

       <i>tcp_keepalive_time</i> (integer; default: 7200; since Linux 2.2)
              The number of seconds a connection needs to be idle before TCP
              begins sending out keep-alive probes.  Keep-alives are sent
              only when the <b>SO_KEEPALIVE </b>socket option is enabled.  The
              default value is 7200 seconds (2 hours).  An idle connection
              is terminated after approximately an additional 11 minutes (9
              probes an interval of 75 seconds apart) when keep-alive is
              enabled.

              Note that underlying connection tracking mechanisms and
              application timeouts may be much shorter.

       <i>tcp_low_latency</i> (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux 2.4.21/2.6)
              If enabled, the TCP stack makes decisions that prefer lower
              latency as opposed to higher throughput.  It this option is
              disabled, then higher throughput is preferred.  An example of
              an application where this default should be changed would be a
              Beowulf compute cluster.

       <i>tcp_max_orphans</i> (integer; default: see below; since Linux 2.4)
              The maximum number of orphaned (not attached to any user file
              handle) TCP sockets allowed in the system.  When this number
              is exceeded, the orphaned connection is reset and a warning is
              printed.  This limit exists only to prevent simple denial-of-
              service attacks.  Lowering this limit is not recommended.
              Network conditions might require you to increase the number of
              orphans allowed, but note that each orphan can eat up to ~64K
              of unswappable memory.  The default initial value is set equal
              to the kernel parameter NR_FILE.  This initial default is
              adjusted depending on the memory in the system.

       <i>tcp_max_syn_backlog</i> (integer; default: see below; since Linux 2.2)
              The maximum number of queued connection requests which have
              still not received an acknowledgement from the connecting
              client.  If this number is exceeded, the kernel will begin
              dropping requests.  The default value of 256 is increased to
              1024 when the memory present in the system is adequate or
              greater (&gt;= 128Mb), and reduced to 128 for those systems with
              very low memory (&lt;= 32Mb).

              Prior to Linux 2.6.20, it was recommended that if this needed
              to be increased above 1024, the size of the SYNACK hash table
              (<b>TCP_SYNQ_HSIZE</b>) in <i>include/net/tcp.h</i> should be modified to
              keep

                  TCP_SYNQ_HSIZE * 16 &lt;= tcp_max_syn_backlog

              and the kernel should be recompiled.  In Linux 2.6.20, the
              fixed sized <b>TCP_SYNQ_HSIZE </b>was removed in favor of dynamic
              sizing.

       <i>tcp_max_tw_buckets</i> (integer; default: see below; since Linux 2.4)
              The maximum number of sockets in TIME_WAIT state allowed in
              the system.  This limit exists only to prevent simple denial-
              of-service attacks.  The default value of NR_FILE*2 is
              adjusted depending on the memory in the system.  If this
              number is exceeded, the socket is closed and a warning is
              printed.

       <i>tcp_moderate_rcvbuf</i> (Boolean; default: enabled; since Linux
       2.4.17/2.6.7)
              If enabled, TCP performs receive buffer auto-tuning,
              attempting to automatically size the buffer (no greater than
              <i>tcp_rmem[2]</i>) to match the size required by the path for full
              throughput.

       <i>tcp_mem</i> (since Linux 2.4)
              This is a vector of 3 integers: [low, pressure, high].  These
              bounds, measured in units of the system page size, are used by
              TCP to track its memory usage.  The defaults are calculated at
              boot time from the amount of available memory.  (TCP can only
              use <i>low memory</i> for this, which is limited to around 900
              megabytes on 32-bit systems.  64-bit systems do not suffer
              this limitation.)

              <i>low</i>       TCP doesn't regulate its memory allocation when the
                        number of pages it has allocated globally is below
                        this number.

              <i>pressure</i>  When the amount of memory allocated by TCP exceeds
                        this number of pages, TCP moderates its memory
                        consumption.  This memory pressure state is exited
                        once the number of pages allocated falls below the
                        <i>low</i> mark.

              <i>high</i>      The maximum number of pages, globally, that TCP will
                        allocate.  This value overrides any other limits
                        imposed by the kernel.

       <i>tcp_mtu_probing</i> (integer; default: 0; since Linux 2.6.17)
              This parameter controls TCP Packetization-Layer Path MTU
              Discovery.  The following values may be assigned to the file:

              0  Disabled

              1  Disabled by default, enabled when an ICMP black hole
                 detected

              2  Always enabled, use initial MSS of <i>tcp_base_mss</i>.

       <i>tcp_no_metrics_save</i> (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux 2.6.6)
              By default, TCP saves various connection metrics in the route
              cache when the connection closes, so that connections
              established in the near future can use these to set initial
              conditions.  Usually, this increases overall performance, but
              it may sometimes cause performance degradation.  If
              <i>tcp_no_metrics_save</i> is enabled, TCP will not cache metrics on
              closing connections.

       <i>tcp_orphan_retries</i> (integer; default: 8; since Linux 2.4)
              The maximum number of attempts made to probe the other end of
              a connection which has been closed by our end.

       <i>tcp_reordering</i> (integer; default: 3; since Linux 2.4)
              The maximum a packet can be reordered in a TCP packet stream
              without TCP assuming packet loss and going into slow start.
              It is not advisable to change this number.  This is a packet
              reordering detection metric designed to minimize unnecessary
              back off and retransmits provoked by reordering of packets on
              a connection.

       <i>tcp_retrans_collapse</i> (Boolean; default: enabled; since Linux 2.2)
              Try to send full-sized packets during retransmit.

       <i>tcp_retries1</i> (integer; default: 3; since Linux 2.2)
              The number of times TCP will attempt to retransmit a packet on
              an established connection normally, without the extra effort
              of getting the network layers involved.  Once we exceed this
              number of retransmits, we first have the network layer update
              the route if possible before each new retransmit.  The default
              is the RFC specified minimum of 3.

       <i>tcp_retries2</i> (integer; default: 15; since Linux 2.2)
              The maximum number of times a TCP packet is retransmitted in
              established state before giving up.  The default value is 15,
              which corresponds to a duration of approximately between 13 to
              30 minutes, depending on the retransmission timeout.  The
              RFC 1122 specified minimum limit of 100 seconds is typically
              deemed too short.

       <i>tcp_rfc1337</i> (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux 2.2)
              Enable TCP behavior conformant with RFC 1337.  When disabled,
              if a RST is received in TIME_WAIT state, we close the socket
              immediately without waiting for the end of the TIME_WAIT
              period.

       <i>tcp_rmem</i> (since Linux 2.4)
              This is a vector of 3 integers: [min, default, max].  These
              parameters are used by TCP to regulate receive buffer sizes.
              TCP dynamically adjusts the size of the receive buffer from
              the defaults listed below, in the range of these values,
              depending on memory available in the system.

              <i>min</i>       minimum size of the receive buffer used by each TCP
                        socket.  The default value is the system page size.
                        (On Linux 2.4, the default value is 4K, lowered to
                        <b>PAGE_SIZE </b>bytes in low-memory systems.)  This value
                        is used to ensure that in memory pressure mode,
                        allocations below this size will still succeed.
                        This is not used to bound the size of the receive
                        buffer declared using <b>SO_RCVBUF </b>on a socket.

              <i>default</i>   the default size of the receive buffer for a TCP
                        socket.  This value overwrites the initial default
                        buffer size from the generic global
                        <i>net.core.rmem_default</i> defined for all protocols.
                        The default value is 87380 bytes.  (On Linux 2.4,
                        this will be lowered to 43689 in low-memory
                        systems.)  If larger receive buffer sizes are
                        desired, this value should be increased (to affect
                        all sockets).  To employ large TCP windows, the
                        <i>net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling</i> must be enabled
                        (default).

              <i>max</i>       the maximum size of the receive buffer used by each
                        TCP socket.  This value does not override the global
                        <i>net.core.rmem_max</i>.  This is not used to limit the
                        size of the receive buffer declared using <b>SO_RCVBUF</b>
                        on a socket.  The default value is calculated using
                        the formula

                            max(87380, min(4MB, <i>tcp_mem</i>[1]*PAGE_SIZE/128))

                        (On Linux 2.4, the default is 87380*2 bytes, lowered
                        to 87380 in low-memory systems).

       <i>tcp_sack</i> (Boolean; default: enabled; since Linux 2.2)
              Enable RFC 2018 TCP Selective Acknowledgements.

       <i>tcp_slow_start_after_idle</i> (Boolean; default: enabled; since Linux
       2.6.18)
              If enabled, provide RFC 2861 behavior and time out the
              congestion window after an idle period.  An idle period is
              defined as the current RTO (retransmission timeout).  If
              disabled, the congestion window will not be timed out after an
              idle period.

       <i>tcp_stdurg</i> (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux 2.2)
              If this option is enabled, then use the RFC 1122
              interpretation of the TCP urgent-pointer field.  According to
              this interpretation, the urgent pointer points to the last
              byte of urgent data.  If this option is disabled, then use the
              BSD-compatible interpretation of the urgent pointer: the
              urgent pointer points to the first byte after the urgent data.
              Enabling this option may lead to interoperability problems.

       <i>tcp_syn_retries</i> (integer; default: 5; since Linux 2.2)
              The maximum number of times initial SYNs for an active TCP
              connection attempt will be retransmitted.  This value should
              not be higher than 255.  The default value is 5, which
              corresponds to approximately 180 seconds.

       <i>tcp_synack_retries</i> (integer; default: 5; since Linux 2.2)
              The maximum number of times a SYN/ACK segment for a passive
              TCP connection will be retransmitted.  This number should not
              be higher than 255.

       <i>tcp_syncookies</i> (Boolean; since Linux 2.2)
              Enable TCP syncookies.  The kernel must be compiled with
              <b>CONFIG_SYN_COOKIES</b>.  Send out syncookies when the syn backlog
              queue of a socket overflows.  The syncookies feature attempts
              to protect a socket from a SYN flood attack.  This should be
              used as a last resort, if at all.  This is a violation of the
              TCP protocol, and conflicts with other areas of TCP such as
              TCP extensions.  It can cause problems for clients and relays.
              It is not recommended as a tuning mechanism for heavily loaded
              servers to help with overloaded or misconfigured conditions.
              For recommended alternatives see <i>tcp_max_syn_backlog</i>,
              <i>tcp_synack_retries</i>, and <i>tcp_abort_on_overflow</i>.

       <i>tcp_timestamps</i> (integer; default: 1; since Linux 2.2)
              Set to one of the following values to enable or disable
              RFC 1323 TCP timestamps:

              0  Disable timestamps.

              1  Enable timestamps as defined in RFC1323 and use random
                 offset for each connection rather than only using the
                 current time.

              2  As for the value 1, but without random offsets.  Setting
                 <i>tcp_timestamps</i> to this value is meaningful since Linux
                 4.10.

       <i>tcp_tso_win_divisor</i> (integer; default: 3; since Linux 2.6.9)
              This parameter controls what percentage of the congestion
              window can be consumed by a single TCP Segmentation Offload
              (TSO) frame.  The setting of this parameter is a tradeoff
              between burstiness and building larger TSO frames.

       <i>tcp_tw_recycle</i> (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux 2.4)
              Enable fast recycling of TIME_WAIT sockets.  Enabling this
              option is not recommended for devices communicating with the
              general Internet or using NAT (Network Address Translation).
              Since some NAT gateways pass through IP timestamp values, one
              IP can appear to have non-increasing timestamps.  See RFC 1323
              (PAWS), RFC 6191.

       <i>tcp_tw_reuse</i> (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux 2.4.19/2.6)
              Allow to reuse TIME_WAIT sockets for new connections when it
              is safe from protocol viewpoint.  It should not be changed
              without advice/request of technical experts.

       <i>tcp_vegas_cong_avoid</i> (Boolean; default: disabled; Linux 2.2 to
       2.6.13)
              Enable TCP Vegas congestion avoidance algorithm.  TCP Vegas is
              a sender-side-only change to TCP that anticipates the onset of
              congestion by estimating the bandwidth.  TCP Vegas adjusts the
              sending rate by modifying the congestion window.  TCP Vegas
              should provide less packet loss, but it is not as aggressive
              as TCP Reno.

       <i>tcp_westwood</i> (Boolean; default: disabled; Linux 2.4.26/2.6.3 to
       2.6.13)
              Enable TCP Westwood+ congestion control algorithm.  TCP
              Westwood+ is a sender-side-only modification of the TCP Reno
              protocol stack that optimizes the performance of TCP
              congestion control.  It is based on end-to-end bandwidth
              estimation to set congestion window and slow start threshold
              after a congestion episode.  Using this estimation, TCP
              Westwood+ adaptively sets a slow start threshold and a
              congestion window which takes into account the bandwidth used
              at the time congestion is experienced.  TCP Westwood+
              significantly increases fairness with respect to TCP Reno in
              wired networks and throughput over wireless links.

       <i>tcp_window_scaling</i> (Boolean; default: enabled; since Linux 2.2)
              Enable RFC 1323 TCP window scaling.  This feature allows the
              use of a large window (&gt; 64K) on a TCP connection, should the
              other end support it.  Normally, the 16 bit window length
              field in the TCP header limits the window size to less than
              64K bytes.  If larger windows are desired, applications can
              increase the size of their socket buffers and the window
              scaling option will be employed.  If <i>tcp_window_scaling</i> is
              disabled, TCP will not negotiate the use of window scaling
              with the other end during connection setup.

       <i>tcp_wmem</i> (since Linux 2.4)
              This is a vector of 3 integers: [min, default, max].  These
              parameters are used by TCP to regulate send buffer sizes.  TCP
              dynamically adjusts the size of the send buffer from the
              default values listed below, in the range of these values,
              depending on memory available.

              <i>min</i>       Minimum size of the send buffer used by each TCP
                        socket.  The default value is the system page size.
                        (On Linux 2.4, the default value is 4K bytes.)  This
                        value is used to ensure that in memory pressure
                        mode, allocations below this size will still
                        succeed.  This is not used to bound the size of the
                        send buffer declared using <b>SO_SNDBUF </b>on a socket.

              <i>default</i>   The default size of the send buffer for a TCP
                        socket.  This value overwrites the initial default
                        buffer size from the generic global
                        <i>/proc/sys/net/core/wmem_default</i> defined for all
                        protocols.  The default value is 16K bytes.  If
                        larger send buffer sizes are desired, this value
                        should be increased (to affect all sockets).  To
                        employ large TCP windows, the
                        <i>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_window_scaling</i> must be set to
                        a nonzero value (default).

              <i>max</i>       The maximum size of the send buffer used by each TCP
                        socket.  This value does not override the value in
                        <i>/proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max</i>.  This is not used to
                        limit the size of the send buffer declared using
                        <b>SO_SNDBUF </b>on a socket.  The default value is
                        calculated using the formula

                            max(65536, min(4MB, <i>tcp_mem</i>[1]*PAGE_SIZE/128))

                        (On Linux 2.4, the default value is 128K bytes,
                        lowered 64K depending on low-memory systems.)

       <i>tcp_workaround_signed_windows</i> (Boolean; default: disabled; since
       Linux 2.6.26)
              If enabled, assume that no receipt of a window-scaling option
              means that the remote TCP is broken and treats the window as a
              signed quantity.  If disabled, assume that the remote TCP is
              not broken even if we do not receive a window scaling option
              from it.

   <b>Socket options</b>
       To set or get a TCP socket option, call <a href="../man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt(2)</a> to read or
       <a href="../man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt(2)</a> to write the option with the option level argument set
       to <b>IPPROTO_TCP</b>.  Unless otherwise noted, <i>optval</i> is a pointer to an
       <i>int</i>.  In addition, most <b>IPPROTO_IP </b>socket options are valid on TCP
       sockets.  For more information see <a href="../man7/ip.7.html">ip(7)</a>.

       <b>TCP_CONGESTION </b>(since Linux 2.6.13)
              The argument for this option is a string.  This option allows
              the caller to set the TCP congestion control algorithm to be
              used, on a per-socket basis.  Unprivileged processes are
              restricted to choosing one of the algorithms in
              <i>tcp_allowed_congestion_control</i> (described above).  Privileged
              processes (<b>CAP_NET_ADMIN</b>) can choose from any of the available
              congestion-control algorithms (see the description of
              <i>tcp_available_congestion_control</i> above).

       <b>TCP_CORK </b>(since Linux 2.2)
              If set, don't send out partial frames.  All queued partial
              frames are sent when the option is cleared again.  This is
              useful for prepending headers before calling <a href="../man2/sendfile.2.html">sendfile(2)</a>, or
              for throughput optimization.  As currently implemented, there
              is a 200 millisecond ceiling on the time for which output is
              corked by <b>TCP_CORK</b>.  If this ceiling is reached, then queued
              data is automatically transmitted.  This option can be
              combined with <b>TCP_NODELAY </b>only since Linux 2.5.71.  This
              option should not be used in code intended to be portable.

       <b>TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT </b>(since Linux 2.4)
              Allow a listener to be awakened only when data arrives on the
              socket.  Takes an integer value (seconds), this can bound the
              maximum number of attempts TCP will make to complete the
              connection.  This option should not be used in code intended
              to be portable.

       <b>TCP_INFO </b>(since Linux 2.4)
              Used to collect information about this socket.  The kernel
              returns a <i>struct tcp_info</i> as defined in the file
              <i>/usr/include/linux/tcp.h</i>.  This option should not be used in
              code intended to be portable.

       <b>TCP_KEEPCNT </b>(since Linux 2.4)
              The maximum number of keepalive probes TCP should send before
              dropping the connection.  This option should not be used in
              code intended to be portable.

       <b>TCP_KEEPIDLE </b>(since Linux 2.4)
              The time (in seconds) the connection needs to remain idle
              before TCP starts sending keepalive probes, if the socket
              option <b>SO_KEEPALIVE </b>has been set on this socket.  This option
              should not be used in code intended to be portable.

       <b>TCP_KEEPINTVL </b>(since Linux 2.4)
              The time (in seconds) between individual keepalive probes.
              This option should not be used in code intended to be
              portable.

       <b>TCP_LINGER2 </b>(since Linux 2.4)
              The lifetime of orphaned FIN_WAIT2 state sockets.  This option
              can be used to override the system-wide setting in the file
              <i>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fin_timeout</i> for this socket.  This is
              not to be confused with the <a href="../man7/socket.7.html">socket(7)</a> level option <b>SO_LINGER</b>.
              This option should not be used in code intended to be
              portable.

       <b>TCP_MAXSEG</b>
              The maximum segment size for outgoing TCP packets.  In Linux
              2.2 and earlier, and in Linux 2.6.28 and later, if this option
              is set before connection establishment, it also changes the
              MSS value announced to the other end in the initial packet.
              Values greater than the (eventual) interface MTU have no
              effect.  TCP will also impose its minimum and maximum bounds
              over the value provided.

       <b>TCP_NODELAY</b>
              If set, disable the Nagle algorithm.  This means that segments
              are always sent as soon as possible, even if there is only a
              small amount of data.  When not set, data is buffered until
              there is a sufficient amount to send out, thereby avoiding the
              frequent sending of small packets, which results in poor
              utilization of the network.  This option is overridden by
              <b>TCP_CORK</b>; however, setting this option forces an explicit
              flush of pending output, even if <b>TCP_CORK </b>is currently set.

       <b>TCP_QUICKACK </b>(since Linux 2.4.4)
              Enable quickack mode if set or disable quickack mode if
              cleared.  In quickack mode, acks are sent immediately, rather
              than delayed if needed in accordance to normal TCP operation.
              This flag is not permanent, it only enables a switch to or
              from quickack mode.  Subsequent operation of the TCP protocol
              will once again enter/leave quickack mode depending on
              internal protocol processing and factors such as delayed ack
              timeouts occurring and data transfer.  This option should not
              be used in code intended to be portable.

       <b>TCP_SYNCNT </b>(since Linux 2.4)
              Set the number of SYN retransmits that TCP should send before
              aborting the attempt to connect.  It cannot exceed 255.  This
              option should not be used in code intended to be portable.

       <b>TCP_USER_TIMEOUT </b>(since Linux 2.6.37)
              This option takes an <i>unsigned int</i> as an argument.  When the
              value is greater than 0, it specifies the maximum amount of
              time in milliseconds that transmitted data may remain
              unacknowledged before TCP will forcibly close the
              corresponding connection and return <b>ETIMEDOUT </b>to the
              application.  If the option value is specified as 0, TCP will
              to use the system default.

              Increasing user timeouts allows a TCP connection to survive
              extended periods without end-to-end connectivity.  Decreasing
              user timeouts allows applications to "fail fast", if so
              desired.  Otherwise, failure may take up to 20 minutes with
              the current system defaults in a normal WAN environment.

              This option can be set during any state of a TCP connection,
              but is effective only during the synchronized states of a
              connection (ESTABLISHED, FIN-WAIT-1, FIN-WAIT-2, CLOSE-WAIT,
              CLOSING, and LAST-ACK).  Moreover, when used with the TCP
              keepalive (<b>SO_KEEPALIVE</b>) option, <b>TCP_USER_TIMEOUT </b>will
              override keepalive to determine when to close a connection due
              to keepalive failure.

              The option has no effect on when TCP retransmits a packet, nor
              when a keepalive probe is sent.

              This option, like many others, will be inherited by the socket
              returned by <a href="../man2/accept.2.html">accept(2)</a>, if it was set on the listening socket.

              Further details on the user timeout feature can be found in
              RFC 793 and RFC 5482 ("TCP User Timeout Option").

       <b>TCP_WINDOW_CLAMP </b>(since Linux 2.4)
              Bound the size of the advertised window to this value.  The
              kernel imposes a minimum size of SOCK_MIN_RCVBUF/2.  This
              option should not be used in code intended to be portable.

   <b>Sockets API</b>
       TCP provides limited support for out-of-band data, in the form of (a
       single byte of) urgent data.  In Linux this means if the other end
       sends newer out-of-band data the older urgent data is inserted as
       normal data into the stream (even when <b>SO_OOBINLINE </b>is not set).
       This differs from BSD-based stacks.

       Linux uses the BSD compatible interpretation of the urgent pointer
       field by default.  This violates RFC 1122, but is required for
       interoperability with other stacks.  It can be changed via
       <i>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_stdurg</i>.

       It is possible to peek at out-of-band data using the <a href="../man2/recv.2.html">recv(2)</a> <b>MSG_PEEK</b>
       flag.

       Since version 2.4, Linux supports the use of <b>MSG_TRUNC </b>in the <i>flags</i>
       argument of <a href="../man2/recv.2.html">recv(2)</a> (and <a href="../man2/recvmsg.2.html">recvmsg(2)</a>).  This flag causes the received
       bytes of data to be discarded, rather than passed back in a caller-
       supplied buffer.  Since Linux 2.4.4, <b>MSG_TRUNC </b>also has this effect
       when used in conjunction with <b>MSG_OOB </b>to receive out-of-band data.

   <b>Ioctls</b>
       The following <a href="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl(2)</a> calls return information in <i>value</i>.  The
       correct syntax is:

              <b>int </b><i>value</i><b>;</b>
              <i>error</i> <b>= ioctl(</b><i>tcp_socket</i><b>, </b><i>ioctl_type</i><b>, &amp;</b><i>value</i><b>);</b>

       <i>ioctl_type</i> is one of the following:

       <b>SIOCINQ</b>
              Returns the amount of queued unread data in the receive
              buffer.  The socket must not be in LISTEN state, otherwise an
              error (<b>EINVAL</b>) is returned.  <b>SIOCINQ </b>is defined in
              <i>&lt;linux/sockios.h&gt;</i>.  Alternatively, you can use the synonymous
              <b>FIONREAD</b>, defined in <i>&lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;</i>.

       <b>SIOCATMARK</b>
              Returns true (i.e., <i>value</i> is nonzero) if the inbound data
              stream is at the urgent mark.

              If the <b>SO_OOBINLINE </b>socket option is set, and <b>SIOCATMARK</b>
              returns true, then the next read from the socket will return
              the urgent data.  If the <b>SO_OOBINLINE </b>socket option is not
              set, and <b>SIOCATMARK </b>returns true, then the next read from the
              socket will return the bytes following the urgent data (to
              actually read the urgent data requires the <b>recv(MSG_OOB)</b>
              flag).

              Note that a read never reads across the urgent mark.  If an
              application is informed of the presence of urgent data via
              <a href="../man2/select.2.html">select(2)</a> (using the <i>exceptfds</i> argument) or through delivery
              of a <b>SIGURG </b>signal, then it can advance up to the mark using a
              loop which repeatedly tests <b>SIOCATMARK </b>and performs a read
              (requesting any number of bytes) as long as <b>SIOCATMARK </b>returns
              false.

       <b>SIOCOUTQ</b>
              Returns the amount of unsent data in the socket send queue.
              The socket must not be in LISTEN state, otherwise an error
              (<b>EINVAL</b>) is returned.  <b>SIOCOUTQ </b>is defined in
              <i>&lt;linux/sockios.h&gt;</i>.  Alternatively, you can use the synonymous
              <b>TIOCOUTQ</b>, defined in <i>&lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;</i>.

   <b>Error handling</b>
       When a network error occurs, TCP tries to resend the packet.  If it
       doesn't succeed after some time, either <b>ETIMEDOUT </b>or the last
       received error on this connection is reported.

       Some applications require a quicker error notification.  This can be
       enabled with the <b>IPPROTO_IP </b>level <b>IP_RECVERR </b>socket option.  When
       this option is enabled, all incoming errors are immediately passed to
       the user program.  Use this option with care — it makes TCP less
       tolerant to routing changes and other normal network conditions.
