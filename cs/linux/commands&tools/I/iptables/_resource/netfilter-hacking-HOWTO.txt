  1.  Introduction

  Hi guys.

  This document is a journey; some parts are well-traveled, and in other
  areas you will find yourself almost alone. The best advice I can give
  you is to grab a large, cozy mug of coffee or hot chocolate, get into
  a comfortable chair, and absorb the contents before venturing out into
  the sometimes dangerous world of network hacking.

  For more understanding of the use of the infrastructure on top of the
  netfilter framework, I recommend reading the Packet Filtering HOWTO
  and the NAT HOWTO. For information on kernel programming I suggest
  Rusty's Unreliable Guide to Kernel Hacking and Rusty's Unreliable
  Guide to Kernel Locking.

  (C) 2000 Paul `Rusty' Russell. Licenced under the GNU GPL.

  1.1.  What is netfilter?

  netfilter is a framework for packet mangling, outside the normal
  Berkeley socket interface. It has four parts. Firstly, each protocol
  defines "hooks" (IPv4 defines 5) which are well-defined points in a
  packet's traversal of that protocol stack. At each of these points,
  the protocol will call the netfilter framework with the packet and the
  hook number.

  Secondly, parts of the kernel can register to listen to the different
  hooks for each protocol. So when a packet is passed to the netfilter
  framework, it checks to see if anyone has registered for that protocol
  and hook; if so, they each get a chance to examine (and possibly
  alter) the packet in order, then discard the packet (NF_DROP), allow
  it to pass (NF_ACCEPT), tell netfilter to forget about the packet
  (NF_STOLEN), or ask netfilter to queue the packet for userspace
  (NF_QUEUE).

  The third part is that packets that have been queued are collected (by
  the ip_queue driver) for sending to userspace; these packets are
  handled asynchronously.

  The final part consists of cool comments in the code and
  documentation. This is instrumental for any experimental project.  The
  netfilter motto is (stolen shamelessly from Cort Dougan):



               ``So... how is this better than KDE?''



  (This motto narrowly edged out `Whip me, beat me, make me use
  ipchains').

  In addition to this raw framework, various modules have been written
  which provide functionality similar to previous (pre-netfilter)
  kernels, in particular, an extensible NAT system, and an extensible
  packet filtering system (iptables).

  1.2.  What's wrong with what we had in 2.0 and 2.2?


  1. No infrastructure established for passing packet to userspace:

     o  Kernel coding is hard

     o  Kernel coding must be done in C/C++

     o  Dynamic filtering policies do not belong in kernel

     o  2.2 introduced copying packets to userspace via netlink, but
        reinjecting packets is slow, and subject to `sanity' checks.
        For example, reinjecting packet claiming to come from an
        existing interface is not possible.


  2. Transparent proxying is a crock:


     o  We look up every packet to see if there is a socket bound to
        that address

     o  Root is allowed to bind to foreign addresses

     o  Can't redirect locally-generated packets

     o  REDIRECT doesn't handle UDP replies: redirecting UDP named
        packets to 1153 doesn't work because some clients don't like
        replies coming from anything other than port 53.

     o  REDIRECT doesn't coordinate with tcp/udp port allocation: a user
        may get a port shadowed by a REDIRECT rule.

     o  Has been broken at least twice during 2.1 series.

     o  Code is extremely intrusive. Consider the stats on the number of
        #ifdef CONFIG_IP_TRANSPARENT_PROXY in 2.2.1: 34 occurrences in
        11 files. Compare this with CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL, which has 10
        occurrences in 5 files.


  3. Creating packet filter rules independent of interface addresses is
     not possible:


     o  Must know local interface addresses to distinguish locally-
        generated or locally-terminating packets from through packets.

     o  Even that is not enough in cases of redirection or masquerading.

     o  Forward chain only has information on outgoing interface,
        meaning you have to figure where a packet came from using
        knowledge of the network topography.


  4. Masquerading is tacked onto packet filtering:

     Interactions between packet filtering and masquerading make
     firewalling complex:

     o  At input filtering, reply packets appear to be destined for box
        itself

     o  At forward filtering, demasqueraded packets are not seen at all

     o  At output filtering, packets appear to come from local box


  5. TOS manipulation, redirect, ICMP unreachable and mark (which can
     effect port forwarding, routing, and QoS) are tacked onto packet
     filter code as well.

  6. ipchains code is neither modular, nor extensible (eg. MAC address
     filtering, options filtering, etc).

  7. Lack of sufficient infrastructure has led to a profusion of
     different techniques:

     o  Masquerading, plus per-protocol modules

     o  Fast static NAT by routing code (doesn't have per-protocol
        handling)

     o  Port forwarding, redirect, auto forwarding

     o  The Linux NAT and Virtual Server Projects.


  8. Incompatibility between CONFIG_NET_FASTROUTE and packet filtering:

     o  Forwarded packets traverse three chains anyway

     o  No way to tell if these chains can be bypassed


  9. Inspection of packets dropped due to routing protection (eg. Source
     Address Verification) not possible.

  10.
     No way of atomically reading counters on packet filter rules.

  11.
     CONFIG_IP_ALWAYS_DEFRAG is a compile-time option, making life
     difficult for distributions who want one general-purpose kernel.

  1.3.  Who are you?

  I'm the only one foolish enough to do this. As ipchains co-author and
  current Linux Kernel IP Firewall maintainer, I see many of the
  problems that people have with the current system, as well as getting
  exposure to what they are trying to do.

  1.4.  Why does it crash?

  Woah! You should have seen it last week!

  Because I'm not as great a programmer as we might all wish, and I
  certainly haven't tested all scenarios, because of lack of time,
  equipment and/or inspiration. I do have a testsuite, which I encourage
  you to contribute to.

  2.  Where Can I Get The Latest?

  There is a CVS server on netfilter.org which contains the latest
  HOWTOs, userspace tools and testsuite. For casual browsing, you can
  use the Web Interface <http://cvs.netfilter.org/>.

  To grab the latest sources, you can do the following:


  1. Log in to the netfilter CVS server anonymously:


       cvs -d :pserver:cvs@pserver.netfilter.org:/cvspublic login



  2. When it asks you for a password type `cvs'.

  3. Check out the code using:


       # cvs -d :pserver:cvs@pserver.netfilter.org:/cvspublic co netfilter/userspace



  4. To update to the latest version, use


       cvs update -d -P



  3.  Netfilter Architecture

  Netfilter is merely a series of hooks in various points in a protocol
  stack (at this stage, IPv4, IPv6 and DECnet). The (idealized) IPv4
  traversal diagram looks like the following:



       A Packet Traversing the Netfilter System:

          --->[1]--->[ROUTE]--->[3]--->[4]--->
                        |            ^
                        |            |
                        |         [ROUTE]
                        v            |
                       [2]          [5]
                        |            ^
                        |            |
                        v            |



  On the left is where packets come in: having passed the simple sanity
  checks (i.e., not truncated, IP checksum OK, not a promiscuous
  receive), they are passed to the netfilter framework's
  NF_IP_PRE_ROUTING [1] hook.

  Next they enter the routing code, which decides whether the packet is
  destined for another interface, or a local process. The routing code
  may drop packets that are unroutable.

  If it's destined for the box itself, the netfilter framework is called
  again for the NF_IP_LOCAL_IN [2] hook, before being passed to the
  process (if any).

  If it's destined to pass to another interface instead, the netfilter
  framework is called for the NF_IP_FORWARD [3] hook.

  The packet then passes a final netfilter hook, the NF_IP_POST_ROUTING
  [4] hook, before being put on the wire again.

  The NF_IP_LOCAL_OUT [5] hook is called for packets that are created
  locally. Here you can see that routing occurs after this hook is
  called: in fact, the routing code is called first (to figure out the
  source IP address and some IP options): if you want to alter the
  routing, you must alter the `skb->dst' field yourself, as is done in
  the NAT code.

  3.1.  Netfilter Base

  Now we have an example of netfilter for IPv4, you can see when each
  hook is activated. This is the essence of netfilter.

  Kernel modules can register to listen at any of these hooks. A module
  that registers a function must specify the priority of the function
  within the hook; then when that netfilter hook is called from the core
  networking code, each module registered at that point is called in the
  order of priorites, and is free to manipulate the packet. The module
  can then tell netfilter to do one of five things:


  1. NF_ACCEPT: continue traversal as normal.

  2. NF_DROP: drop the packet; don't continue traversal.

  3. NF_STOLEN: I've taken over the packet; don't continue traversal.

  4. NF_QUEUE: queue the packet (usually for userspace handling).

  5. NF_REPEAT: call this hook again.

  The other parts of netfilter (handling queued packets, cool comments)
  will be covered in the kernel section later.

  Upon this foundation, we can build fairly complex packet
  manipulations, as shown in the next two sections.

  3.2.  Packet Selection: IP Tables

  A packet selection system called IP Tables has been built over the
  netfilter framework. It is a direct descendent of ipchains (that came
  from ipfwadm, that came from BSD's ipfw IIRC), with extensibility.
  Kernel modules can register a new table, and ask for a packet to
  traverse a given table. This packet selection method is used for
  packet filtering (the `filter' table), Network Address Translation
  (the `nat' table) and general pre-route packet mangling (the `mangle'
  table).

  The hooks that are registered with netfilter are as follows (with the
  functions in each hook in the order that they are actually called):



          --->PRE------>[ROUTE]--->FWD---------->POST------>
              Conntrack    |       Mangle   ^    Mangle
              Mangle       |       Filter   |    NAT (Src)
              NAT (Dst)    |                |    Conntrack
              (QDisc)      |             [ROUTE]
                           v                |
                           IN Filter       OUT Conntrack
                           |  Conntrack     ^  Mangle
                           |  Mangle        |  NAT (Dst)
                           v                |  Filter



  3.2.1.  Packet Filtering

  This table, `filter', should never alter packets: only filter them.

  One of the advantages of iptables filter over ipchains is that it is
  small and fast, and it hooks into netfilter at the NF_IP_LOCAL_IN,
  NF_IP_FORWARD and NF_IP_LOCAL_OUT points. This means that for any
  given packet, there is one (and only one) possible place to filter it.
  This makes things much simpler for users than ipchains was. Also, the
  fact that the netfilter framework provides both the input and output
  interfaces for the NF_IP_FORWARD hook means that many kinds of
  filtering are far simpler.

  Note: I have ported the kernel portions of both ipchains and ipfwadm
  as modules on top of netfilter, enabling the use of the old ipfwadm
  and ipchains userspace tools without requiring an upgrade.

  3.2.2.  NAT

  This is the realm of the `nat' table, which is fed packets from two
  netfilter hooks: for non-local packets, the NF_IP_PRE_ROUTING and
  NF_IP_POST_ROUTING hooks are perfect for destination and source
  alterations respectively. If CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT_LOCAL is defined, the
  hooks NF_IP_LOCAL_OUT and NF_IP_LOCAL_IN are used for altering the
  destination of local packets.

  This table is slightly different from the `filter' table, in that only
  the first packet of a new connection will traverse the table: the
  result of this traversal is then applied to all future packets in the
  same connection.

  3.2.2.1.  Masquerading, Port Forwarding, Transparent Proxying

  I divide NAT into Source NAT (where the first packet has its source
  altered), and Destination NAT (the first packet has its destination
  altered).

  Masquerading is a special form of Source NAT: port forwarding and
  transparent proxying are special forms of Destination NAT. These are
  now all done using the NAT framework, rather than being independent
  entities.

  3.2.3.  Packet Mangling

  The packet mangling table (the `mangle' table) is used for actual
  changing of packet information. Example applications are the TOS and
  TCPMSS targets. The mangle table hooks into all five netfilter hooks.
  (please note this changed with kernel 2.4.18. Previous kernels didn't
  have mangle attached to all hooks)

  3.3.  Connection Tracking

  Connection tracking is fundamental to NAT, but it is implemented as a
  separate module; this allows an extension to the packet filtering code
  to simply and cleanly use connection tracking (the `state' module).

  3.4.  Other Additions

  The new flexibility provides both the opportunity to do really funky
  things, but for people to write enhancements or complete replacements
  that can be mixed and matched.

  4.  Information for Programmers

  I'll let you in on a secret: my pet hamster did all the coding. I was
  just a channel, a `front' if you will, in my pet's grand plan.  So,
  don't blame me if there are bugs. Blame the cute, furry one.

  4.1.  Understanding ip_tables

  iptables simply provides a named array of rules in memory (hence the
  name `iptables'), and such information as where packets from each hook
  should begin traversal. After a table is registered, userspace can
  read and replace its contents using getsockopt() and setsockopt().

  iptables does not register with any netfilter hooks: it relies on
  other modules to do that and feed it the packets as appropriate; a
  module must register the netfilter hooks and ip_tables separately, and
  provide the mechanism to call ip_tables when the hook is reached.

  4.1.1.  ip_tables Data Structures

  For convenience, the same data structure is used to represent a rule
  by userspace and within the kernel, although a few fields are only
  used inside the kernel.

  Each rule consists of the following parts:

  1. A `struct ipt_entry'.

  2. Zero or more `struct ipt_entry_match' structures, each with a
     variable amount (0 or more bytes) of data appended to it.

  3. A `struct ipt_entry_target' structure, with a variable amount (0 or
     more bytes) of data appended to it.

  The variable nature of the rule gives a huge amount of flexibility for
  extensions, as we'll see, especially as each match or target can carry
  an arbitrary amount of data. This does create a few traps, however: we
  have to watch out for alignment. We do this by ensuring that the
  `ipt_entry', `ipt_entry_match' and `ipt_entry_target' structures are
  conveniently sized, and that all data is rounded up to the maximal
  alignment of the machine using the IPT_ALIGN() macro.

  The `struct ipt_entry' has the following fields:

  1. A `struct ipt_ip' part, containing the specifications for the IP
     header that it is to match.

  2. An `nf_cache' bitfield showing what parts of the packet this rule
     examined.

  3. A `target_offset' field indicating the offset from the beginning of
     this rule where the ipt_entry_target structure begins.  This should
     always be aligned correctly (with the IPT_ALIGN macro).

  4. A `next_offset' field indicating the total size of this rule,
     including the matches and target. This should also be aligned
     correctly using the IPT_ALIGN macro.

  5. A `comefrom' field used by the kernel to track packet traversal.

  6. A `struct ipt_counters' field containing the packet and byte
     counters for packets which matched this rule.

  The `struct ipt_entry_match' and `struct ipt_entry_target' are very
  similar, in that they contain a total (IPT_ALIGN'ed) length field
  (`match_size' and `target_size' respectively) and a union holding the
  name of the match or target (for userspace), and a pointer (for the
  kernel).

  Because of the tricky nature of the rule data structure, some helper
  routines are provided:


     ipt_get_target()
        This inline function returns a pointer to the target of a rule.

     IPT_MATCH_ITERATE()
        This macro calls the given function for every match in the given
        rule. The function's first argument is the `struct
        ipt_match_entry', and other arguments (if any) are those
        supplied to the IPT_MATCH_ITERATE() macro. The function must
        return either zero for the iteration to continue, or a non-zero
        value to stop.

     IPT_ENTRY_ITERATE()
        This function takes a pointer to an entry, the total size of the
        table of entries, and a function to call.  The functions first
        argument is the `struct ipt_entry', and other arguments (if any)
        are those supplied to the IPT_ENTRY_ITERATE() macro. The
        function must return either zero for the iteration to continue,
        or a non-zero value to stop.

  4.1.2.  ip_tables From Userspace

  Userspace has four operations: it can read the current table, read the
  info (hook positions and size of table), replace the table (and grab
  the old counters), and add in new counters.

  This allows any atomic operation to be simulated by userspace: this is
  done by the libiptc library, which provides convenience
  "add/delete/replace" semantics for programs.

  Because these tables are transferred into kernel space, alignment
  becomes an issue for machines which have different userspace and
  kernelspace type rules (eg. Sparc64 with 32-bit userland). These cases
  are handled by overriding the definition of IPT_ALIGN for these
  platforms in `libiptc.h'.

  4.1.3.  ip_tables Use And Traversal

  The kernel starts traversing at the location indicated by the
  particular hook. That rule is examined, if the `struct ipt_ip'
  elements match, each `struct ipt_entry_match' is checked in turn (the
  match function associated with that match is called). If the match
  function returns 0, iteration stops on that rule. If it sets the
  `hotdrop' parameter to 1, the packet will also be immediately dropped
  (this is used for some suspicious packets, such as in the tcp match
  function).

  If the iteration continues to the end, the counters are incremented,
  the `struct ipt_entry_target' is examined: if it's a standard target,
  the `verdict' field is read (negative means a packet verdict, positive
  means an offset to jump to). If the answer is positive and the offset
  is not that of the next rule, the `back' variable is set, and the
  previous `back' value is placed in that rule's `comefrom' field.

  For non-standard targets, the target function is called: it returns a
  verdict (non-standard targets can't jump, as this would break the
  static loop-detection code). The verdict can be IPT_CONTINUE, to
  continue on to the next rule.

  4.2.  Extending iptables

  Because I'm lazy, iptables is fairly extensible. This is basically a
  scam to palm off work onto other people, which is what Open Source is
  all about (cf. Free Software, which as RMS would say, is about
  freedom, and I was sitting in one of his talks when I wrote this).

  Extending iptables potentially involves two parts: extending the
  kernel, by writing a new module, and possibly extending the userspace
  program iptables, by writing a new shared library.

  4.2.1.  The Kernel

  Writing a kernel module itself is fairly simple, as you can see from
  the examples. One thing to be aware of is that your code must be re-
  entrant: there can be one packet coming in from userspace, while
  another arrives on an interrupt. In fact in SMP there can be one
  packet on an interrupt per CPU in 2.3.4 and above.

  The functions you need to know about are:


     init_module()
        This is the entry-point of the module. It returns a negative
        error number, or 0 if it successfully registers itself with
        netfilter.

     cleanup_module()
        This is the exit point of the module; it should unregister
        itself with netfilter.

     ipt_register_match()
        This is used to register a new match type. You hand it a `struct
        ipt_match', which is usually declared as a static (file-scope)
        variable.

     ipt_register_target()
        This is used to register a new type. You hand it a `struct
        ipt_target', which is usually declared as a static (file-scope)
        variable.

     ipt_unregister_target()
        Used to unregister your target.

     ipt_unregister_match()
        Used to unregister your match.

  One warning about doing tricky things (such as providing counters) in
  the extra space in your new match or target. On SMP machines, the
  entire table is duplicated using memcpy for each CPU: if you really
  want to keep central information, you should see the method used in
  the `limit' match.

  4.2.1.1.  New Match Functions

  New match functions are usually written as a standalone module.  It's
  possible to have these modules extensible in turn, although it's
  usually not necessary. One way would be to use the netfilter
  framework's `nf_register_sockopt' function to allows users to talk to
  your module directly. Another way would be to export symbols for other
  modules to register themselves, the same way netfilter and ip_tables
  do.

  The core of your new match function is the struct ipt_match which it
  passes to `ipt_register_match()'. This structure has the following
  fields:


     list
        This field is set to any junk, say `{ NULL, NULL }'.

     name
        This field is the name of the match function, as referred to by
        userspace. The name should match the name of the module (i.e.,
        if the name is "mac", the module must be "ipt_mac.o") for auto-
        loading to work.

     match
        This field is a pointer to a match function, which takes the
        skb, the in and out device pointers (one of which may be NULL,
        depending on the hook), a pointer to the match data in the rule
        that is worked on (the structure that was prepared in
        userspace), the IP offset (non-zero means a non-head fragment),
        a pointer to the protocol header (i.e., just past the IP
        header), the length of the data (ie. the packet length minus the
        IP header length) and finally a pointer to a `hotdrop' variable.
        It should return non-zero if the packet matches, and can set
        `hotdrop' to 1 if it returns 0, to indicate that the packet must
        be dropped immediately.

     checkentry
        This field is a pointer to a function which checks the
        specifications for a rule; if this returns 0, then the rule will
        not be accepted from the user. For example, the "tcp" match type
        will only accept tcp packets, and so if the `struct ipt_ip' part
        of the rule does not specify that the protocol must be tcp, a
        zero is returned. The tablename argument allows your match to
        control what tables it can be used in, and the `hook_mask' is a
        bitmask of hooks this rule may be called from: if your match
        does not make sense from some netfilter hooks, you can avoid
        that here.

     destroy
        This field is a pointer to a function which is called when an
        entry using this match is deleted. This allows you to
        dynamically allocate resources in checkentry and clean them up
        here.

     me This field is set to `THIS_MODULE', which gives a pointer to
        your module. It causes the usage-count to go up and down as
        rules of that type are created and destroyed. This prevents a
        user removing the module (and hence cleanup_module() being
        called) if a rule refers to it.

  4.2.1.2.  New Targets

  If your target alters the packet (ie. the headers or the body), it
  must call skb_unshare() to copy the packet in case it is cloned:
  otherwise any raw sockets which have a clone of the skbuff will see
  the alterations (ie. people will see wierd stuff happening in
  tcpdump).

  New targets are also usually written as a standalone module. The
  discussions under the above section on `New Match Functions' apply
  equally here.

  The core of your new target is the struct ipt_target that it passes to
  ipt_register_target(). This structure has the following fields:


     list
        This field is set to any junk, say `{ NULL, NULL }'.

     name
        This field is the name of the target function, as referred to by
        userspace. The name should match the name of the module (i.e.,
        if the name is "REJECT", the module must be "ipt_REJECT.o") for
        auto-loading to work.

     target
        This is a pointer to the target function, which takes the
        skbuff, the hook number, the input and output device pointers
        (either of which may be NULL), a pointer to the target data, and
        the position of the rule in the table. The target function may
        return either IPT_CONTINUE (-1) if traversing should continue,
        or a netfilter verdict (NF_DROP, NF_ACCEPT, NF_STOLEN etc.).

     checkentry
        This field is a pointer to a function which checks the
        specifications for a rule; if this returns 0, then the rule will
        not be accepted from the user.

     destroy
        This field is a pointer to a function which is called when an
        entry using this target is deleted. This allows you to
        dynamically allocate resources in checkentry and clean them up
        here.

     me This field is set to `THIS_MODULE', which gives a pointer to
        your module. It causes the usage-count to go up and down as
        rules with this as a target are created and destroyed. This
        prevents a user removing the module (and hence cleanup_module()
        being called) if a rule refers to it.

  4.2.1.3.  New Tables

  You can create a new table for your specific purpose if you wish.  To
  do this, you call `ipt_register_table()', with a `struct ipt_table',
  which has the following fields:


     list
        This field is set to any junk, say `{ NULL, NULL }'.

     name
        This field is the name of the table function, as referred to by
        userspace. The name should match the name of the module (i.e.,
        if the name is "nat", the module must be "iptable_nat.o") for
        auto-loading to work.

     table
        This is a fully-populated `struct ipt_replace', as used by
        userspace to replace a table. The `counters' pointer should be
        set to NULL. This data structure can be declared `__initdata' so
        it is discarded after boot.

     valid_hooks
        This is a bitmask of the IPv4 netfilter hooks you will enter the
        table with: this is used to check that those entry points are
        valid, and to calculate the possible hooks for ipt_match and
        ipt_target `checkentry()' functions.

     lock
        This is the read-write spinlock for the entire table; initialize
        it to RW_LOCK_UNLOCKED.

     private
        This is used internally by the ip_tables code.

  4.2.2.  Userspace Tool

  Now you've written your nice shiny kernel module, you may want to
  control the options on it from userspace. Rather than have a branched
  version of iptables for each extension, I use the very latest 90's
  technology: furbies. Sorry, I mean shared libraries.

  New tables generally don't require any extension to iptables: the user
  just uses the `-t' option to make it use the new table.

  The shared library should have an `_init()' function, which will
  automatically be called upon loading: the moral equivalent of the
  kernel module's `init_module()' function. This should call
  `register_match()' or `register_target()', depending on whether your
  shared library provides a new match or a new target.

  You need to provide a shared library: this can be used to initialize
  part of the structure, or provide additional options. I now insist on
  a shared library even if it doesn't do anything, to reduce problem
  reports where the shares libraries are missing.

  There are useful functions described in the `iptables.h' header,
  especially:

     check_inverse()
        checks if an argument is actually a `!', and if so, sets the
        `invert' flag if not already set. If it returns true, you should
        increment optind, as done in the examples.

     string_to_number()
        converts a string into a number in the given range, returning -1
        if it is malformed or out of range.  `string_to_number' rely on
        `strtol' (see the manpage), meaning that a leading "0x" would
        make the number be in Hexadecimal base, a leading "0" would make
        it be in Octal base.

     exit_error()
        should be called if an error is found.  Usually the first
        argument is `PARAMETER_PROBLEM', meaning the user didn't use the
        command line correctly.

  4.2.2.1.  New Match Functions

  Your shared library's _init() function hands `register_match()' a
  pointer to a static `struct iptables_match', which has the following
  fields:


     next
        This pointer is used to make a linked list of matches (such as
        used for listing rules). It should be set to NULL initially.

     name
        The name of the match function. This should match the library
        name (eg "tcp" for `libipt_tcp.so').

     version
        Usually set to the IPTABLES_VERSION macro: this is used to
        ensure that the iptables binary doesn't pick up the wrong shared
        libraries by mistake.

     size
        The size of the match data for this match; you should use the
        IPT_ALIGN() macro to ensure it is correctly aligned.

     userspacesize
        For some matches, the kernel changes some fields internally (the
        `limit' target is a case of this). This means that a simple
        `memcmp()' is insufficient to compare two rules (required for
        delete-matching-rule functionality). If this is the case, place
        all the fields which do not change at the start of the
        structure, and put the size of the unchanging fields here.
        Usually, however, this will be identical to the `size' field.

     help
        A function which prints out the option synopsis.

     init
        This can be used to initialize the extra space (if any) in the
        ipt_entry_match structure, and set any nfcache bits; if you are
        examining something not expressible using the contents of
        `linux/include/netfilter_ipv4.h', then simply OR in the
        NFC_UNKNOWN bit. It will be called before `parse()'.

     parse
        This is called when an unrecognized option is seen on the
        command line: it should return non-zero if the option was indeed
        for your library. `invert' is true if a `!' has already been
        seen.  The `flags' pointer is for the exclusive use of your
        match library, and is usually used to store a bitmask of options
        which have been specified. Make sure you adjust the nfcache
        field. You may extend the size of the `ipt_entry_match'
        structure by reallocating if necessary, but then you must ensure
        that the size is passed through the IPT_ALIGN macro.

     final_check
        This is called after the command line has been parsed, and is
        handed the `flags' integer reserved for your library.  This
        gives you a chance to check that any compulsory options have
        been specified, for example: call `exit_error()' if this is the
        case.

     print
        This is used by the chain listing code to print (to standard
        output) the extra match information (if any) for a rule. The
        numeric flag is set if the user specified the `-n' flag.

     save
        This is the reverse of parse: it is used by `iptables-save' to
        reproduce the options which created the rule.

     extra_opts
        This is a NULL-terminated list of extra options which your
        library offers. This is merged with the current options and
        handed to getopt_long; see the man page for details. The return
        code for getopt_long becomes the first argument (`c') to your
        `parse()' function.

  There are extra elements at the end of this structure for use
  internally by iptables: you don't need to set them.

  4.2.2.2.  New Targets

  Your shared library's _init() function hands `register_target()' it a
  pointer to a static `struct iptables_target', which has similar fields
  to the iptables_match structure detailed above.

  4.2.3.  Using `libiptc'

  libiptc is the iptables control library, designed for listing and
  manipulating rules in the iptables kernel module. While its current
  use is for the iptables program, it makes writing other tools fairly
  easy. You need to be root to use these functions.

  The kernel tables themselves are simply a table of rules, and a set of
  numbers representing entry points. Chain names ("INPUT", etc) are
  provided as an abstraction by the library. User defined chains are
  labelled by inserting an error node before the head of the user-
  defined chain, which contains the chain name in the extra data section
  of the target (the builtin chain positions are defined by the three
  table entry points).

  The following standard targets are supported: ACCEPT, DROP, QUEUE
  (which are translated to NF_ACCEPT, NF_DROP, and NF_QUEUE,
  respectively), RETURN (which is translated to a special IPT_RETURN
  value handled by ip_tables), and JUMP (which is translated from the
  chain name to an actual offset within the table).

  When `iptc_init()' is called, the table, including the counters, is
  read. This table is manipulated by the `iptc_insert_entry()',
  `iptc_replace_entry()', `iptc_append_entry()', `iptc_delete_entry()',
  `iptc_delete_num_entry()', `iptc_flush_entries()',
  `iptc_zero_entries()', `iptc_create_chain()' `iptc_delete_chain()',
  and `iptc_set_policy()' functions.

  The table changes are not written back until the `iptc_commit()'
  function is called. This means it is possible for two library users
  operating on the same chain to race each other; locking would be
  required to prevent this, and it is not currently done.

  There is no race with counters, however; counters are added back in to
  the kernel in such a way that counter increments between the reading
  and writing of the table still show up in the new table.

  There are various helper functions:


     iptc_first_chain()
        This function returns the first chain name in the table.

     iptc_next_chain()
        This function returns the next chain name in the table: NULL
        means no more chains.

     iptc_builtin()
        Returns true if the given chain name is the name of a builtin
        chain.

     iptc_first_rule()
        This returns a pointer to the first rule in the given chain
        name: NULL for an empty chain.

     iptc_next_rule()
        This returns a pointer to the next rule in the chain: NULL means
        the end of the chain.

     iptc_get_target()
        This gets the target of the given rule. If it's an extended
        target, the name of that target is returned. If it's a jump to
        another chain, the name of that chain is returned. If it's a
        verdict (eg. DROP), that name is returned. If it has no target
        (an accounting-style rule), then the empty string is returned.

        Note that this function should be used instead of using the
        value of the `verdict' field of the ipt_entry structure
        directly, as it offers the above further interpretations of the
        standard verdict.

     iptc_get_policy()
        This gets the policy of a builtin chain, and fills in the
        `counters' argument with the hit statistics on that policy.

     iptc_strerror()
        This function returns a more meaningful explanation of a failure
        code in the iptc library. If a function fails, it will always
        set errno: this value can be passed to iptc_strerror() to yield
        an error message.

  4.3.  Understanding NAT

  Welcome to Network Address Translation in the kernel. Note that the
  infrastructure offered is designed more for completeness than raw
  efficiency, and that future tweaks may increase the efficiency
  markedly. For the moment I'm happy that it works at all.

  NAT is separated into connection tracking (which doesn't manipulate
  packets at all), and the NAT code itself. Connection tracking is also
  designed to be used by an iptables modules, so it makes subtle
  distinctions in states which NAT doesn't care about.

  4.3.1.  Connection Tracking

  Connection tracking hooks into high-priority NF_IP_LOCAL_OUT and
  NF_IP_PRE_ROUTING hooks, in order to see packets before they enter the
  system.

  The nfct field in the skb is a pointer to inside the struct
  ip_conntrack, at one of the infos[] array. Hence we can tell the state
  of the skb by which element in this array it is pointing to: this
  pointer encodes both the state structure and the relationship of this
  skb to that state.

  The best way to extract the `nfct' field is to call
  `ip_conntrack_get()', which returns NULL if it's not set, or the
  connection pointer, and fills in ctinfo which describes the
  relationship of the packet to that connection. This enumerated type
  has several values:


     IP_CT_ESTABLISHED
        The packet is part of an established connection, in the original
        direction.

     IP_CT_RELATED
        The packet is related to the connection, and is passing in the
        original direction.

     IP_CT_NEW
        The packet is trying to create a new connection (obviously, it
        is in the original direction).

     IP_CT_ESTABLISHED + IP_CT_IS_REPLY
        The packet is part of an established connection, in the reply
        direction.

     IP_CT_RELATED + IP_CT_IS_REPLY
        The packet is related to the connection, and is passing in the
        reply direction.

  Hence a reply packet can be identified by testing for >=
  IP_CT_IS_REPLY.

  4.4.  Extending Connection Tracking/NAT

  These frameworks are designed to accommodate any number of protocols
  and different mapping types. Some of these mapping types might be
  quite specific, such as a load-balancing/fail-over mapping type.

  Internally, connection tracking converts a packet to a "tuple",
  representing the interesting parts of the packet, before searching for
  bindings or rules which match it. This tuple has a manipulatable part,
  and a non-manipulatable part; called "src" and "dst", as this is the
  view for the first packet in the Source NAT world (it'd be a reply
  packet in the Destination NAT world). The tuple for every packet in
  the same packet stream in that direction is the same.

  For example, a TCP packet's tuple contains the manipulatable part:
  source IP and source port, the non-manipulatable part: destination IP
  and the destination port. The manipulatable and non-manipulatable
  parts do not need to be the same type though; for example, an ICMP
  packet's tuple contains the manipulatable part: source IP and the ICMP
  id, and the non-manipulatable part: the destination IP and the ICMP
  type and code.

  Every tuple has an inverse, which is the tuple of the reply packets in
  the stream. For example, the inverse of an ICMP ping packet, icmp id
  12345, from 192.168.1.1 to 1.2.3.4, is a ping-reply packet, icmp id
  12345, from 1.2.3.4 to 192.168.1.1.

  These tuples, represented by the `struct ip_conntrack_tuple', are used
  widely. In fact, together with the hook the packet came in on (which
  has an effect on the type of manipulation expected), and the device
  involved, this is the complete information on the packet.

  Most tuples are contained within a `struct ip_conntrack_tuple_hash',
  which adds a doubly linked list entry, and a pointer to the connection
  that the tuple belongs to.

  A connection is represented by the `struct ip_conntrack': it has two
  `struct ip_conntrack_tuple_hash' fields: one referring to the
  direction of the original packet (tuplehash[IP_CT_DIR_ORIGINAL]), and
  one referring to packets in the reply direction
  (tuplehash[IP_CT_DIR_REPLY]).

  Anyway, the first thing the NAT code does is to see if the connection
  tracking code managed to extract a tuple and find an existing
  connection, by looking at the skbuff's nfct field; this tells us if
  it's an attempt on a new connection, or if not, which direction it is
  in; in the latter case, then the manipulations determined previously
  for that connection are done.

  If it was the start of a new connection, we look for a rule for that
  tuple, using the standard iptables traversal mechanism, on the `nat'
  table. If a rule matches, it is used to initialize the manipulations
  for both that direction and the reply; the connection-tracking code is
  told that the reply it should expect has changed. Then, it's
  manipulated as above.

  If there is no rule, a `null' binding is created: this usually does
  not map the packet, but exists to ensure we don't map another stream
  over an existing one. Sometimes, the null binding cannot be created,
  because we have already mapped an existing stream over it, in which
  case the per-protocol manipulation may try to remap it, even though
  it's nominally a `null' binding.

  4.4.1.  Standard NAT Targets

  NAT targets are like any other iptables target extensions, except they
  insist on being used only in the `nat' table. Both the SNAT and DNAT
  targets take a `struct ip_nat_multi_range' as their extra data; this
  is used to specify the range of addresses a mapping is allowed to bind
  into. A range element, `struct ip_nat_range' consists of an inclusive
  minimum and maximum IP address, and an inclusive maximum and minimum
  protocol-specific value (eg. TCP ports). There is also room for flags,
  which say whether the IP address can be mapped (sometimes we only want
  to map the protocol-specific part of a tuple, not the IP), and another
  to say that the protocol-specific part of the range is valid.

  A multi-range is an array of these `struct ip_nat_range' elements;
  this means that a range could be "1.1.1.1-1.1.1.2 ports 50-55 AND
  1.1.1.3 port 80". Each range element adds to the range (a union, for
  those who like set theory).

  4.4.2.  New Protocols

  4.4.2.1.  Inside The Kernel

  Implementing a new protocol first means deciding what the
  manipulatable and non-manipulatable parts of the tuple should be.
  Everything in the tuple has the property that it identifies the stream
  uniquely. The manipulatable part of the tuple is the part you can do
  NAT with: for TCP this is the source port, for ICMP it's the icmp ID;
  something to use as a "stream identifier". The non-manipulatable part
  is the rest of the packet that uniquely identifies the stream, but we
  can't play with (eg. TCP destination port, ICMP type).

  Once you've decided this, you can write an extension to the
  connection-tracking code in the directory, and go about populating the
  `ip_conntrack_protocol' structure which you need to pass to
  `ip_conntrack_register_protocol()'.

  The fields of `struct ip_conntrack_protocol' are:


     list
        Set it to '{ NULL, NULL }'; used to sew you into the list.

     proto
        Your protocol number; see `/etc/protocols'.

     name
        The name of your protocol. This is the name the user will see;
        it's usually best if it's the canonical name in
        `/etc/protocols'.

     pkt_to_tuple
        The function which fills out the protocol specific parts of the
        tuple, given the packet. The `datah' pointer points to the start
        of your header (just past the IP header), and the datalen is the
        length of the packet. If the packet isn't long enough to contain
        the header information, return 0; datalen will always be at
        least 8 bytes though (enforced by framework).

     invert_tuple
        This function is simply used to change the protocol-specific
        part of the tuple into the way a reply to that packet would
        look.

     print_tuple
        This function is used to print out the protocol-specific part of
        a tuple; usually it's sprintf()'d into the buffer provided. The
        number of buffer characters used is returned.  This is used to
        print the states for the /proc entry.

     print_conntrack
        This function is used to print the private part of the conntrack
        structure, if any, also used for printing the states in /proc.

     packet
        This function is called when a packet is seen which is part of
        an established connection. You get a pointer to the conntrack
        structure, the IP header, the length, and the ctinfo. You return
        a verdict for the packet (usually NF_ACCEPT), or -1 if the
        packet is not a valid part of the connection. You can delete the
        connection inside this function if you wish, but you must use
        the following idiom to avoid races (see
        ip_conntrack_proto_icmp.c):



          if (del_timer(&ct->timeout))
                  ct->timeout.function((unsigned long)ct);



     new
        This function is called when a packet creates a connection for
        the first time; there is no ctinfo arg, since the first packet
        is of ctinfo IP_CT_NEW by definition. It returns 0 to fail to
        create the connection, or a connection timeout in jiffies.

  Once you've written and tested that you can track your new protocol,
  it's time to teach NAT how to translate it. This means writing a new
  module; an extension to the NAT code and go about populating the
  `ip_nat_protocol' structure which you need to pass to
  `ip_nat_protocol_register()'.


     list
        Set it to '{ NULL, NULL }'; used to sew you into the list.

     name
        The name of your protocol. This is the name the user will see;
        it's best if it's the canonical name in `/etc/protocols' for
        userspace auto-loading, as we'll see later.

     protonum
        Your protocol number; see `/etc/protocols'.

     manip_pkt
        This is the other half of connection tracking's pkt_to_tuple
        function: you can think of it as "tuple_to_pkt". There are some
        differences though: you get a pointer to the start of the IP
        header, and the total packet length. This is because some
        protocols (UDP, TCP) need to know the IP header. You're given
        the ip_nat_tuple_manip field from the tuple (i.e., the "src"
        field), rather than the entire tuple, and the type of
        manipulation you are to perform.

     in_range
        This function is used to tell if manipulatable part of the given
        tuple is in the given range. This function is a bit tricky:
        we're given the manipulation type which has been applied to the
        tuple, which tells us how to interpret the range (is it a source
        range or a destination range we're aiming for?).

        This function is used to check if an existing mapping puts us in
        the right range, and also to check if no manipulation is
        necessary at all.

     unique_tuple
        This function is the core of NAT: given a tuple and a range,
        we're to alter the per-protocol part of the tuple to place it
        within the range, and make it unique. If we can't find an unused
        tuple in the range, return 0. We also get a pointer to the
        conntrack structure, which is required for ip_nat_used_tuple().

        The usual approach is to simply iterate the per-protocol part of
        the tuple through the range, checking `ip_nat_used_tuple()' on
        it, until one returns false.

        Note that the null-mapping case has already been checked: it's
        either outside the range given, or already taken.

        If IP_NAT_RANGE_PROTO_SPECIFIED isn't set, it means that the
        user is doing NAT, not NAPT: do something sensible with the
        range. If no mapping is desirable (for example, within TCP, a
        destination mapping should not change the TCP port unless
        ordered to), return 0.

     print
        Given a character buffer, a match tuple and a mask, write out
        the per-protocol parts and return the length of the buffer used.

     print_range
        Given a character buffer and a range, write out the per-protocol
        part of the range, and return the length of the buffer used.
        This won't be called if the IP_NAT_RANGE_PROTO_SPECIFIED flag
        wasn't set for the range.

  4.4.3.  New NAT Targets

  This is the really interesting part. You can write new NAT targets
  which provide a new mapping type: two extra targets are provided in
  the default package: MASQUERADE and REDIRECT. These are fairly simple
  to illustrate the potential and power of writing a new NAT target.

  These are written just like any other iptables targets, but internally
  they will extract the connection and call `ip_nat_setup_info()'.

  4.4.4.  Protocol Helpers

  Protocol helpers for connection tracking allow the connection tracking
  code to understand protocols which use multiple network connections
  (eg. FTP) and mark the `child' connections as being related to the
  initial connection, usually by reading the related address out of the
  data stream.

  Protocol helpers for NAT do two things: firstly allow the NAT code to
  manipulate the data stream to change the address contained within it,
  and secondly to perform NAT on the related connection when it comes
  in, based on the original connection.

  4.4.5.  Connection Tracking Helper Modules

  4.4.5.1.  Description

  The duty of a connection tracking module is to specify which packets
  belong to an already established connection. The module has the
  following means to do that:


  o  Tell netfilter which packets our module is interested in (most
     helpers operate on a particular port).

  o  Register a function with netfilter. This function is called for
     every packet which matches the criteria above.

  o  An `ip_conntrack_expect_related()' function which can be called
     from there to tell netfilter to expect related connections.

  If there is some additional work to be done at the time the first
  packet of the expected connection arrives, the module can register a
  callback function which is called at that time.

  4.4.5.2.  Structures and Functions Available

  Your kernel module's init function has to call
  `ip_conntrack_helper_register()' with a pointer to a `struct
  ip_conntrack_helper'. This struct has the following fields:


     list
        This is the header for the linked list. Netfilter handles this
        list internally. Just initialize it with `{ NULL, NULL }'.

     name
        This is a pointer to a string constant specifying the name of
        the protocol. ("ftp", "irc", ...)

     flags
        A set of flags with one or more out of the following flgs:

        o  IP_CT_HELPER_F_REUSE_EXPECTReuse expectations if the limit
           (see `max_expected` below) is reached.

     me A pointer to the module structure of the helper. Intitialize
        this with the `THIS_MODULE' macro.

     max_expected
        Maximum number of unconfirmed (outstanding) expectations.

     timeout
        Timeout (in seconds) for each unconfirmed expectation. An
        expectation is deleted `timeout' seconds after the expectation
        was issued with the `ip_conntrack_expect_related()' function.

     tuple
        This is a `struct ip_conntrack_tuple' which specifies the
        packets our conntrack helper module is interested in.

     mask
        Again a `struct ip_conntrack_tuple'. This mask specifies which
        bits of tuple are valid.

     help
        The function which netfilter should call for each packet
        matching tuple+mask

  4.4.6.  NAT helper modules

  4.4.6.1.  Description

  NAT helper modules do some application specific NAT handling. Usually
  this includes on-the-fly manipulation of data: think about the PORT
  command in FTP, where the client tells the server which IP/port to
  connect to. Therefor an FTP helper module must replace the IP/port
  after the PORT command in the FTP control connection.

  If we are dealing with TCP, things get slightly more complicated. The
  reason is a possible change of the packet size (FTP example: the
  length of the string representing an IP/port tuple after the PORT
  command has changed). If we change the packet size, we have a syn/ack
  difference between left and right side of the NAT box. (i.e. if we had
  extended one packet by 4 octets, we have to add this offset to the TCP
  sequence number of each following packet).

  Special NAT handling of all related packets is required, too. Take as
  example again FTP, where all incoming packets of the DATA connection
  have to be NATed to the IP/port given by the client with the PORT
  command on the control connection, rather than going through the
  normal table lookup.


  o  callback for the packet causing the related connection (foo_help)

  o  callback for all related packets (foo_nat_expected)

  4.4.6.2.  Structures and Functions Available

  Your nat helper module's `init()' function calls
  `ip_nat_helper_register()' with a pointer to a `struct ip_nat_helper'.
  This struct has the following members:


     list
        Just again the list header for netfilters internal use.
        Initialize this with { NULL, NULL }.

     name
        A pointer to a string constant with the protocol's name

     flags
        A set out of zero, one or more of the following flags:

        o  IP_NAT_HELPER_F_ALWAYSCall the NAT helper for every packet,
           not only for packets where conntrack has detected an
           expectation-cause.

        o  IP_NAT_HELPER_F_STANDALONETell the NAT core that this
           protocol doesn't have a conntrack helper, only a NAT helper.

     me A pointer to the module structure of the helper. Initialize this
        using the `THIS_MODULE' macro.

     tuple
        a `struct ip_conntrack_tuple' describing which packets our NAT
        helper is interested in.

     mask
        a `struct ip_conntrack_tuple', telling netfilter which bits of
        tuple are valid.

     help
        The help function which is called for each packet matching
        tuple+mask.

     expect
        The expect function which is called for every first packet of an
        expected connection.


  This is very similar to writing a connection tracking helper.

  4.5.  Understanding Netfilter

  Netfilter is pretty simple, and is described fairly thoroughly in the
  previous sections. However, sometimes it's necessary to go beyond what
  the NAT or ip_tables infrastructure offers, or you may want to replace
  them entirely.

  One important issue for netfilter (well, in the future) is caching.
  Each skb has an `nfcache' field: a bitmask of what fields in the
  header were examined, and whether the packet was altered or not. The
  idea is that each hook off netfilter OR's in the bits relevant to it,
  so that we can later write a cache system which will be clever enough
  to realize when packets do not need to be passed through netfilter at
  all.

  The most important bits are NFC_ALTERED, meaning the packet was
  altered (this is already used for IPv4's NF_IP_LOCAL_OUT hook, to
  reroute altered packets), and NFC_UNKNOWN, which means caching should
  not be done because some property which cannot be expressed was
  examined. If in doubt, simply set the NFC_UNKNOWN flag on the skb's
  nfcache field inside your hook.

  4.6.  Writing New Netfilter Modules

  4.6.1.  Plugging Into Netfilter Hooks

  To receive/mangle packets inside the kernel, you can simply write a
  module which registers a "netfilter hook". This is basically an
  expression of interest at some given point; the actual points are
  protocol-specific, and defined in protocol-specific netfilter headers,
  such as "netfilter_ipv4.h".

  To register and unregister netfilter hooks, you use the functions
  `nf_register_hook' and `nf_unregister_hook'. These each take a pointer
  to a `struct nf_hook_ops', which you populate as follows:


     list
        Used to sew you into the linked list: set to '{ NULL, NULL }'

     hook
        The function which is called when a packet hits this hook point.
        Your function must return NF_ACCEPT, NF_DROP or NF_QUEUE.  If
        NF_ACCEPT, the next hook attached to that point will be called.
        If NF_DROP, the packet is dropped. If NF_QUEUE, it's queued. You
        receive a pointer to an skb pointer, so you can entirely replace
        the skb if you wish.

     flush
        Currently unused: designed to pass on packet hits when the cache
        is flushed. May never be implemented: set it to NULL.

     pf The protocol family, eg, `PF_INET' for IPv4.

     hooknum
        The number of the hook you are interested in, eg
        `NF_IP_LOCAL_OUT'.

  4.6.2.  Processing Queued Packets

  This interface is currently used by ip_queue; you can register to
  handle queued packets for a given protocol. This has similar semantics
  to registering for a hook, except you can block processing the packet,
  and you only see packets for which a hook has replied `NF_QUEUE'.

  The two functions used to register interest in queued packets are
  `nf_register_queue_handler()' and `nf_unregister_queue_handler()'. The
  function you register will be called with the `void *' pointer you
  handed it to `nf_register_queue_handler()'.

  If no-one is registered to handle a protocol, then returning NF_QUEUE
  is equivalent to returning NF_DROP.

  Once you have registered interest in queued packets, they begin
  queueing. You can do whatever you want with them, but you must call
  `nf_reinject()' when you are finished with them (don't simply
  kfree_skb() them). When you reinject an skb, you hand it the skb, the
  `struct nf_info' which your queue handler was given, and a verdict:
  NF_DROP causes them to be dropped, NF_ACCEPT causes them to continue
  to iterate through the hooks, NF_QUEUE causes them to be queued again,
  and NF_REPEAT causes the hook which queued the packet to be consulted
  again (beware infinite loops).

  You can look inside the `struct nf_info' to get auxiliary information
  about the packet, such as the interfaces and hook it was on.

  4.6.3.  Receiving Commands From Userspace

  It is common for netfilter components to want to interact with
  userspace. The method for doing this is by using the setsockopt
  mechanism. Note that each protocol must be modified to call
  nf_setsockopt() for setsockopt numbers it doesn't understand (and
  nf_getsockopt() for getsockopt numbers), and so far only IPv4, IPv6
  and DECnet have been modified.

  Using a now-familiar technique, we register a `struct nf_sockopt_ops'
  using the nf_register_sockopt() call. The fields of this structure are
  as follows:


     list
        Used to sew it into the linked list: set to '{ NULL, NULL }'.

     pf The protocol family you handle, eg. PF_INET.

     set_optmin
        and

     set_optmax
        These specify the (exclusive) range of setsockopt numbers
        handled.  Hence using 0 and 0 means you have no setsockopt
        numbers.

     set
        This is the function called when the user calls one of your
        setsockopts. You should check that they have NET_ADMIN
        capability within this function.

     get_optmin
        and

     get_optmax
        These specify the (exclusive) range of getsockopt numbers
        handled.  Hence using 0 and 0 means you have no getsockopt
        numbers.

     get
        This is the function called when the user calls one of your
        getsockopts. You should check that they have NET_ADMIN
        capability within this function.

  The final two fields are used internally.

  4.7.  Packet Handling in Userspace

  Using the libipq library and the `ip_queue' module, almost anything
  which can be done inside the kernel can now be done in userspace.
  This means that, with some speed penalty, you can develop your code
  entirely in userspace. Unless you are trying to filter large
  bandwidths, you should find this approach superior to in-kernel packet
  mangling.

  In the very early days of netfilter, I proved this by porting an
  embryonic version of iptables to userspace. Netfilter opens the doors
  for more people to write their own, fairly efficient netmangling
  modules, in whatever language they want.

  5.  Translating 2.0 and 2.2 Packet Filter Modules

  Look at the ip_fw_compat.c file for a simple layer which should make
  porting quite simple.

  6.  Netfilter Hooks for Tunnel Writers

  Authors of tunnel (or encapsulation) drivers should follow two simple
  rules for the 2.4 kernel (as do the drivers inside the kernel, like
  net/ipv4/ipip.c):


  o  Release skb->nfct if you're going to make the packet unrecognisable
     (ie. decapsulating/encapsulating). You don't need to do this if you
     unwrap it into a *new* skb, but if you're going to do it in place,
     you must do this.


     Otherwise: the NAT code will use the old connection tracking
     information to mangle the packet, with bad consequences.


  o  Make sure the encapsulated packets go through the LOCAL_OUT hook,
     and decapsulated packets go through the PRE_ROUTING hook (most
     tunnels use ip_rcv(), which does this for you).


     Otherwise: the user will not be able to filter as they expect to
     with tunnels.

  The canonical way to do the first is to insert code like the following
  before you wrap or unwrap the packet:



               /* Tell the netfilter framework that this packet is not the
                 same as the one before! */
       #ifdef CONFIG_NETFILTER
               nf_conntrack_put(skb->nfct);
               skb->nfct = NULL;
       #ifdef CONFIG_NETFILTER_DEBUG
               skb->nf_debug = 0;
       #endif
       #endif



  Usually, all you need to do for the second, is to find where the newly
  encapsulated packet goes into "ip_send()", and replace it with
  something like:



               /* Send "new" packet from local host */
               NF_HOOK(PF_INET, NF_IP_LOCAL_OUT, skb, NULL, rt->u.dst.dev, ip_send);



  Following these rules means that the person setting up the packet
  filtering rules on the tunnel box will see something like the
  following sequence for a packet being tunnelled:


  1. FORWARD hook: normal packet (from eth0 -> tunl0)

  2. LOCAL_OUT hook: encapsulated packet (to eth1).

  And for the reply packet:

  1. LOCAL_IN hook: encapsulated reply packet (from eth1)

  2. FORWARD hook: reply packet (from eth1 -> eth0).

  7.  The Test Suite

  Within the CVS repository lives a test suite: the more the test suite
  covers, the greater confidence you can have that changes to the code
  hasn't quietly broken something. Trivial tests are at least as
  important as tricky tests: it's the trivial tests which simplify the
  complex tests (since you know the basics work fine before the complex
  test gets run).

  The tests are simple: they are just shell scripts under the testsuite/
  subdirectory which are supposed to succeed. The scripts are run in
  alphabetical order, so `01test' is run before `02test'.  Currently
  there are 5 test directories:


     00netfilter/
        General netfilter framework tests.

     01iptables/
        iptables tests.

     02conntrack/
        connection tracking tests.

     03NAT/
        NAT tests

     04ipchains-compat/
        ipchains/ipfwadm compatibility tests

  Inside the testsuite/ directory is a script called `test.sh'. It
  configures two dummy interfaces (tap0 and tap1), turns forwarding on,
  and removes all netfilter modules. Then it runs through the
  directories above and runs each of their test.sh scripts until one
  fails. This script takes two optional arguments: `-v' meaning to print
  out each test as it proceeds, and an optional test name: if this is
  given, it will skip over all tests until this one is found.

  7.1.  Writing a Test

  Create a new file in the appropriate directory: try to number your
  test so that it gets run at the right time. For example, in order to
  test ICMP reply tracking (02conntrack/02reply.sh), we need to first
  check that outgoing ICMPs are tracked properly
  (02conntrack/01simple.sh).

  It's usually better to create many small files, each of which covers
  one area, because it helps to isolate problems immediately for people
  running the testsuite.

  If something goes wrong in the test, simply do an `exit 1', which
  causes failure; if it's something you expect may fail, you should
  print a unique message. Your test should end with `exit 0' if
  everything goes OK. You should check the success of every command,
  either using `set -e' at the top of the script, or appending `|| exit
  1' to the end of each command.

  The helper functions `load_module' and `remove_module' can be used to
  load modules: you should never rely on autoloading in the testsuite
  unless that is what you are specifically testing.

  7.2.  Variables And Environment

  You have two play interfaces: tap0 and tap1. Their interface addresses
  are in variables $TAP0 and $TAP1 respectively. They both have netmasks
  of 255.255.255.0; their networks are in $TAP0NET and $TAP1NET
  respectively.

  There is an empty temporary file in $TMPFILE. It is deleted at the end
  of your test.

  Your script will be run from the testsuite/ directory, wherever it is.
  Hence you should access tools (such as iptables) using path starting
  with `../userspace'.

  Your script can print out more information if $VERBOSE is set (meaning
  that the user specified `-v' on the command line).

  7.3.  Useful Tools

  There are several useful testsuite tools in the "tools" subdirectory:
  each one exits with a non-zero exit status if there is a problem.

  7.3.1.  gen_ip

  You can generate IP packets using `gen_ip', which outputs an IP packet
  to standard input. You can feed packets in the tap0 and tap1 by
  sending standard output to /dev/tap0 and /dev/tap1 (these are created
  upon first running the testsuite if they don't exist).

  gen_ip is a simplistic program which is currently very fussy about its
  argument order. First are the general optional arguments:


     FRAG=offset,length
        Generate the packet, then turn it into a fragment at the
        following offset and length.

     MF Set the `More Fragments' bit on the packet.

     MAC=xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
        Set the source MAC address on the packet.

     TOS=tos
        Set the TOS field on the packet (0 to 255).


  Next come the compulsory arguments:


     source ip
        Source IP address of the packet.

     dest ip
        Destination IP address of the packet.

     length
        Total length of the packet, including headers.

     protocol
        Protocol number of the packet, eg 17 = UDP.


  Then the arguments depend on the protocol: for UDP (17), they are the
  source and destination port numbers. For ICMP (1), they are the type
  and code of the ICMP message: if the type is 0 or 8 (ping-reply or
  ping), then two additional arguments (the ID and sequence fields) are
  required. For TCP, the source and destination ports, and flags ("SYN",
  "SYN/ACK", "ACK", "RST" or "FIN") are required. There are three
  optional arguments: "OPT=" followed by a comma-separated list of
  options, "SYN=" followed by a sequence number, and "ACK=" followed by
  a sequence number. Finally, the optional argument "DATA" indicates
  that the payload of the TCP packet is to be filled with the contents
  of standard input.

  7.3.2.  rcv_ip

  You can see IP packets using `rcv_ip', which prints out the command
  line as close as possible to the original value fed to gen_ip
  (fragments are the exception).

  This is extremely useful for analyzing packets. It takes two
  compulsory arguments:


     wait time
        The maximum time in seconds to wait for a packet from standard
        input.

     iterations
        The number of packets to receive.

  There is one optional argument, "DATA", which causes the payload of a
  TCP packet to be printed on standard output after the packet header.

  The standard way to use `rcv_ip' in a shell script is as follows:


  # Set up job control, so we can use & in shell scripts.
  set -m

  # Wait two seconds for one packet from tap0
  ../tools/rcv_ip 2 1 < /dev/tap0 > $TMPFILE &

  # Make sure that rcv_ip has started running.
  sleep 1

  # Send a ping packet
  ../tools/gen_ip $TAP1NET.2 $TAP0NET.2 100 1 8 0 55 57 > /dev/tap1 || exit 1

  # Wait for rcv_ip,
  if wait %../tools/rcv_ip; then :
  else
      echo rcv_ip failed:
      cat $TMPFILE
      exit 1
  fi



  7.3.3.  gen_err

  This program takes a packet (as generated by gen_ip, for example) on
  standard input, and turns it into an ICMP error.

  It takes three arguments: a source IP address, a type and a code.  The
  destination IP address will be set to the source IP address of the
  packet fed in standard input.

  7.3.4.  local_ip

  This takes a packet from standard input and injects it into the system
  from a raw socket. This give the appearance of a locally-generated
  packet (as separate from feeding a packet in one of the ethertap
  devices, which looks like a remotely-generated packet).

  7.4.  Random Advice

  All the tools assume they can do everything in one read or write: this
  is true for the ethertap devices, but might not be true if you're
  doing something tricky with pipes.

  dd can be used to cut packets: dd has an obs (output block size)
  option which can be used to make it output the packet in a single
  write.

  Test for success first: eg. testing that packets are successfully
  blocked. First test that packets pass through normally, then test that
  some packets are blocked. Otherwise an unrelated failure could be
  stopping the packets...

  Try to write exact tests, not `throw random stuff and see what
  happens' tests. If an exact test goes wrong, it's a useful thing to
  know. If a random test goes wrong once, it doesn't help much.

  If a test fails without a message, you can add `-x' to the top line of
  the script (ie. `#! /bin/sh -x') to see what commands it's running.

  If a test fails randomly, check for random network traffic interfering
  (try downing all your external interfaces). Sitting on the same
  network as Andrew Tridgell, I tend to get plagued by Windows
  broadcasts, for example.

  8.  Motivation

  As I was developing ipchains, I realized (in one of those blinding-
  flash-while-waiting-for-entree moments in a Chinese restaurant in
  Sydney) that packet filtering was being done in the wrong place. I
  can't find it now, but I remember sending mail to Alan Cox, who kind
  of said `why don't you finish what you're doing, first, even though
  you're probably right'. In the short term, pragmatism was to win over
  The Right Thing.

  After I finished ipchains, which was initially going to be a minor
  modification of the kernel part of ipfwadm, and turned into a larger
  rewrite, and wrote the HOWTO, I became aware of just how much
  confusion there is in the wider Linux community about issues like
  packet filtering, masquerading, port forwarding and the like.

  This is the joy of doing your own support: you get a closer feel for
  what the users are trying to do, and what they are struggling with.
  Free software is most rewarding when it's in the hands of the most
  users (that's the point, right?), and that means making it easy.  The
  architecture, not the documentation, was the key flaw.

  So I had the experience, with the ipchains code, and a good idea of
  what people out there were doing. There were only two problems.

  Firstly, I didn't want to get back into security. Being a security
  consultant is a constant moral tug-of-war between your conscience and
  your wallet. At a fundamental level, you are selling the feeling of
  security, which is at odds with actual security. Maybe working in a
  military setting, where they understand security, it'd be different.

  The second problem is that newbie users aren't the only concern; an
  increasing number of large companies and ISPs are using this stuff. I
  needed reliable input from that class of users if it was to scale to
  tomorrow's home users.

  These problems were resolved, when I ran into David Bonn, of
  WatchGuard fame, at Usenix in July 1998. They were looking for a Linux
  kernel coder; in the end we agreed that I'd head across to their
  Seattle offices for a month and we'd see if we could hammer out an
  agreement whereby they'd sponsor my new code, and my current support
  efforts. The rate we agreed on was more than I asked, so I didn't take
  a pay cut. This means I don't have to even think about external
  conslutting for a while.

  Exposure to WatchGuard gave me exposure to the large clients I need,
  and being independent from them allowed me to support all users (eg.
  WatchGuard competitors) equally.

  So I could have simply written netfilter, ported ipchains over the
  top, and been done with it. Unfortunately, that would leave all the
  masquerading code in the kernel: making masquerading independent from
  filtering is the one of the major wins point of moving the packet
  filtering points, but to do that masquerading also needed to be moved
  over to the netfilter framework as well.

  Also, my experience with ipfwadm's `interface-address' feature (the
  one I removed in ipchains) had taught me that there was no hope of
  simply ripping out the masquerading code and expecting someone who
  needed it to do the work of porting it onto netfilter for me.

  So I needed to have at least as many features as the current code;
  preferably a few more, to encourage niche users to become early
  adopters. This means replacing transparent proxying (gladly!),
  masquerading and port forwarding. In other words, a complete NAT
  layer.

  Even if I had decided to port the existing masquerading layer, instead
  of writing a generic NAT system, the masquerading code was showing its
  age, and lack of maintenance. See, there was no masquerading
  maintainer, and it shows. It seems that serious users generally don't
  use masquerading, and there aren't many home users up to the task of
  doing maintenance. Brave people like Juan Ciarlante were doing fixes,
  but it had reached to the stage (being extended over and over) that a
  rewrite was needed.

  Please note that I wasn't the person to do a NAT rewrite: I didn't use
  masquerading any more, and I'd not studied the existing code at the
  time. That's probably why it took me longer than it should have.  But
  the result is fairly good, in my opinion, and I sure as hell learned a
  lot. No doubt the second version will be even better, once we see how
  people use it.
