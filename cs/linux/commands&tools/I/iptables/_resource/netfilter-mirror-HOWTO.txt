  1.  Introduction

  So you are interested in hosting a mirror of the netfilter.org
  project.  This is good news, thank you for considering it. Please note
  that the netfilter/iptables project is quite popular, and the traffic
  to your website can be quite high. The netfilter.org main server
  kashyyyk.netfilter.org always has 100GB to 150GB per month, but that
  includes CVS and the mailinglists.

  2.  Mirror of the www.netfilter.org homepage

  2.1.  Step zero: Do we need a mirror for your country?

  The netfilter/iptables project issues names for mirror sites depending
  on the country you are located. Usually a mirror would have a name
  like www.ccTLD.netfilter.org, where ccTLD is to be replaced with your
  country code top level domain (e.g. www.de.netfilter.org for germany).

  Please make sure that we don't already have a mirror for your country.
  At the moment we can only accept one mirror per country.

  2.2.  Step one: Prerequirements

  2.2.1.  rsync

  The netfilter.org project offers the whole homepage directory via the
  rsync protocol. If you don't know what rsync is, or don't have rsync
  on your machine(s), we will not be able to use your mirror. Sorry.

  More information about rsync can be found at the rsync homepage
  <http://samba.org/rsync/>.

  2.2.2.  Webserver

  Apart from rsync, you will need a webserver that can server HTTP 1.1
  name based virtual hosts.

  2.2.3.  Diskspace Requirements

  The netfilter homepage is currently 50MB in size. I expect it to grow
  to 100, maybe 150MB in the future. Considering the size of today's
  hard drives, I don't think that anybody has problems with the size.

  2.2.4.  Traffic Requirements

  Hard to tell. As we will not use any kind of load sharing, the
  distribution of the traffic happens 'manually'. This means, that the
  amount of traffic depends on the number of users that explicitly use
  www.ccTLD.netfilter.org instead of www.netfilter.org.

  The total traffic of www.netfilter.org before we had any official
  mirrors was about 50GB per month.

  2.3.  Step two: Getting the netfilter homepage

  You can download the netfilter homepage by using the following
  command:


       rsync -av --delete rsync.netfilter.org::www/ target_directory/



  2.4.  Step three: Configuring the name based virtual host

  You will need to configure a name based virtual host for the following
  hostnames:



       www.ccTLD.netfilter.org
       www.ccTLD.iptables.org
       ccTLD.netfilter.org
       ccTLD.iptables.org
       mirror.netfilter.org
       mirror.iptables.org



  2.5.  Step four: Telling us about your new mirror

  Send a short email with the IP address of your new homepage mirror to
  mirrormaster@netfilter.org <mailto:mirrormaster@netfilter.org>. We
  will then inform you once the DNS record has been entered into the
  netfilter.org and iptables.org zone file.

  3.  Mirror of the ftp.netfilter.org

  3.1.  Which type of mirror? Setting up a mirror of the ftp server can
  be done in two ways.

  3.1.1.  Mirror as ftp.ccTLD.netfilter.org

  Since FTP doesn't have a concept of name based virtual hosts, you
  would need to allocate an extra IP address for this ftp server.

  3.1.2.  Mirror as ftp.something.do.main/pub/netfilter

  This is the common case, where you mirror our FTP directory into a
  subdirectory of your FTP server.

  If you can put the mirror in the path given above (/pub/netfilter), we
  can also provide you with a ftp.ccTLD.netfilter.org hostname. If the
  directory appears somewhere else in your directory tree, we will not
  give you this kind of hostname for consistency reasons. Sorry.

  3.2.  Step zero: Do we need a mirror for your country?

  The netfilter/iptables project issues names for mirror sites depending
  on the country you are located. Usually a mirror would have a name
  like ftp.ccTLD.netfilter.org, where ccTLD is to be replaced with your
  country code top level domain (e.g. ftp.de.netfilter.org for germany).

  Please make sure that we don't already have a mirror for your country.
  At the moment we can only accept one mirror per country.

  3.3.  Step one: Prerequirements

  3.3.1.  rsync

  The netfilter.org project offers the whole homepage directory via the
  rsync protocol. If you don't know what rsync is, or don't have rsync
  on your machine(s), we will not be able to use your mirror. Sorry.

  More information about rsync can be found at the rsync homepage
  <http://samba.org/rsync/>.

  3.3.2.  Diskspace Requirements

  The netfilter FTP site is currently about 50MB in size. I expect it to
  grow to 150, maybe max. 250MB in the future. Considering the size of
  today's hard drives, I don't think that anybody has problems with the
  size.

  3.3.3.  Traffic Requirements

  Hard to tell. As we will not use any kind of load sharing, the
  distribution of the traffic happens 'manually'. This means, that the
  amount of traffic depends on the number of users that explicitly use
  ftp.ccTLD.netfilter.org instead of ftp.netfilter.org.

  The total traffic of ftp.netfilter.org before we had any official
  mirrors was about 50GB per month.

  3.4.  Step two: Getting the netfilter FTP tree

  You can download the netfilter homepage by using the following
  command:


       rsync -av --delete rsync.netfilter.org::ftp/ target_directory/



  3.5.  Step three: Telling us about your new mirror

  Send a short email with the IP address of your new FTP mirror to
  mirrormaster@netfilter.org <mailto:mirrormaster@netfilter.org>. We
  will then inform you once the DNS record has been entered into the
  netfilter.org and iptables.org zone file.

  4.  The netfilter-mirrors mailinglist

  We have set up a mailinglist for
  discussion/announcements/questions/comments among the netfilter.org
  mirror administrators. If you want to host a mirror site, subscription
  to that list is mandatory. As soon as we put your IP address into our
  zone file, your email address will be subscribed to that mailinglist.
  Please note that posting to this list is restricted to members, so
  please don't send mails with a 'From' address different from the one
  subscribed. You can manage your list subscription at the netfilter-
  mirrors@lists.netfilter.org admin interface
  <http://lists.netfilter.org/mailman/listinfo/netfilter-mirrors>.

  5.  Mirror of other netfilter.org services

  The netfilter/iptables project provides a number of other services,
  such as anonymous CVS, mailing list archives, bugzilla, CVSweb.

  At this time we are not looking for mirrors for any of those services.
