几种多态：

* ad hoc多态

  > when a function denotes different and potentially heterogeneous implementations depending on a limited range of individually specified types and combinations

  很多语言中，通过方法重载来支持ad hoc多态

* 参数化（parametric）多态

  > when code is written without mention of any specific type and thus can be used transparently with any number of new types

  泛化

* subtyping（subtype多态）

  > when a name denotes instances of many different classes related by some common superclass

  OOP中多指 继承
