Double-Checked Locking is widely cited and used
as an efficient method for implementing
lazy initialization
in a multithreaded environment.

</p><p>Unfortunately, it 
will not work reliably in a platform independent way
when implemented in Java, without additional synchronization.
When implemented in other languages, such as C++, it depends on
the memory model of the processor, the reorderings performed by
the compiler and the interaction between the compiler and the synchronization
library. Since none of these are specified in a language such as C++, 
little can be said about the situations in which it will work. Explicit
memory barriers can be used to make it work in C++, but these barriers are
not available in Java.

</p><p>
To first explain the desired behavior, consider the following code:

</p><p>
<table border="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<pre>// Single threaded version
class Foo { 
  private Helper helper = null;
  public Helper getHelper() {
    if (helper == null) 
        helper = new Helper();
    return helper;
    }
  // other functions and members...
  }
</pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p>
If this code was used in a multithreaded context,
many things could go wrong. Most obviously, two or more
<tt>Helper</tt> objects could be allocated. (We'll bring up other problems
later).
The fix to this is simply to synchronize the <tt>getHelper()</tt> method:

</p><p>
<table border="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<pre>// Correct multithreaded version
class Foo { 
  private Helper helper = null;
  public synchronized Helper getHelper() {
    if (helper == null) 
        helper = new Helper();
    return helper;
    }
  // other functions and members...
  }
</pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p>
The code above performs synchronization every time <tt>getHelper()</tt> 
is called.
The double-checked locking idiom tries to avoid synchronization
after the helper is allocated:

</p><p>
<table border="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<pre>// Broken multithreaded version
// "Double-Checked Locking" idiom
class Foo { 
  private Helper helper = null;
  public Helper getHelper() {
    if (helper == null) 
      synchronized(this) {
        if (helper == null) 
          helper = new Helper();
      }    
    return helper;
    }
  // other functions and members...
  }
</pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p>
Unfortunately, that code just
does not work in the presence of either optimizing compilers
or shared memory multiprocessors.


</p><h2>It doesn't work</h2>
<p>There are lots of reasons it doesn't work. The first couple of
reasons we'll describe are more obvious. After understanding those, you may be tempted
to try to devise a way to "fix" the double-checked locking idiom. Your fixes will not
work: there are more subtle reasons why your fix won't work. Understand those
reasons, come up with a better fix, and it still won't work, because there are even
more subtle reasons.

</p><p>Lots of very smart people have spent lots of time looking at this. 
There is <em>no way</em> to make it work without requiring each thread that
accesses the helper object to perform synchronization.


</p><h3>The first reason it doesn't work</h3>
<p>The most obvious reason it doesn't work it
that the writes that initialize the <tt>Helper</tt> object
and the write to the <tt>helper</tt> field can be done or perceived 
out of order. Thus, a thread which invokes getHelper() could see a non-null 
reference to a helper object, but see the default values for fields of the 
helper object, rather than the values set in the constructor.

</p><p>
If the compiler inlines the call to the constructor, then the writes
that initialize the object and the write to the <tt>helper</tt> field
can be freely reordered if the compiler can prove that the constructor
cannot throw an exception or perform synchronization.

</p><p>Even if the compiler does not reorder those writes, on a multiprocessor
the processor or the memory system may reorder those writes, 
as perceived by
a thread running on another
processor.

</p><p>Doug Lea has written
a <a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/cpj/jmm.html">more 
detailed description of compiler-based reorderings</a>.

</p><h4>A test case showing that it doesn't work</h4>
<p>Paul Jakubik found an example of a use of double-checked locking
that did not work correctly. <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/%7Epugh/java/memoryModel/DoubleCheckTest.java">A slightly cleaned up version
of that code is available here</a>.

</p><p>When run on a system using the Symantec JIT, it doesn't work.
In particular, the Symantec JIT compiles
</p><center>
<pre>singletons[i].reference = new Singleton();</pre>
</center>
<p>to the following (note that the Symantec JIT using
a handle-based object allocation system).
</p><pre>0206106A   mov         eax,0F97E78h
0206106F   call        01F6B210                  ; allocate space for
                                                 ; Singleton, return result in eax
02061074   mov         dword ptr [ebp],eax       ; EBP is &amp;singletons[i].reference 
                                                ; store the unconstructed object here.
02061077   mov         ecx,dword ptr [eax]       ; dereference the handle to
                                                 ; get the raw pointer
02061079   mov         dword ptr [ecx],100h      ; Next 4 lines are
0206107F   mov         dword ptr [ecx+4],200h    ; Singleton's inlined constructor
02061086   mov         dword ptr [ecx+8],400h
0206108D   mov         dword ptr [ecx+0Ch],0F84030h
</pre>

<p>As you can see, the assignment to <tt>singletons[i].reference</tt>
is performed before the constructor for Singleton is called.
This is completely legal under the existing Java memory model,
and also legal in C and C++ (since neither of them have a memory model).
</p><h4>A fix that doesn't work</h4>
<p>Given the explanation above, a number of people have suggested the 
following code:
</p><p>
<table border="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<pre>// (Still) Broken multithreaded version
// "Double-Checked Locking" idiom
class Foo { 
  private Helper helper = null;
  public Helper getHelper() {
    if (helper == null) {
      Helper h;
      synchronized(this) {
        h = helper;
        if (h == null) 
            synchronized (this) {
              h = new Helper();
            } // release inner synchronization lock
        helper = h;
        } 
      }    
    return helper;
    }
  // other functions and members...
  }
</pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p>This code puts construction of the Helper object inside an inner synchronized block. 
The intuitive idea here is that there should be a memory
barrier at the point where synchronization is released, and that should
prevent the reordering of the initialization of the <tt>Helper</tt> object
and the assignment to the field helper.

</p><p>Unfortunately, that intuition is absolutely wrong. The rules for
synchronization don't work that way.
The rule for a monitorexit (i.e., releasing synchronization) is that
actions before the monitorexit must be performed before the monitor
is released. However, there is no rule which says that actions after
the monitorexit may not be done before the monitor is released. 
It is perfectly reasonable and legal for the compiler to move
the assignment <tt>helper = h;</tt> inside the synchronized block,
in which case we are back where we were previously. Many processors
offer instructions that perform this kind of one-way memory barrier.
Changing the semantics to require releasing a lock to be a full memory
barrier would have performance penalties.

<!--
<p>Another problem is that the compiler can see that the inner synchronization
block is redundant and eliminate it.
-->


</p><h4><a name="readersNeedSync">More fixes that don't work</a></h4>
<p>There is something you can do to force the writer to perform a full 
bidirectional
memory barrier.  This is gross, inefficient, and is almost guaranteed 
not to work once the Java Memory Model is revised. Do not use this. 
In the interests of science, <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/%7Epugh/java/memoryModel/BidirectionalMemoryBarrier.html">I've put a description of this technique on
a separate page.</a> Do not use it.


</p><p><em>However</em>, even with a full memory barrier being performed by
the thread that initializes the helper object, it still doesn't work.

</p><p>The problem is that on some systems, the thread
which sees a non-null value for the <tt>helper</tt> field also needs to perform
memory barriers.

</p><p> Why? Because processors have their own locally cached copies of memory.
On some processors, unless the processor performs a cache coherence instruction
(e.g., a memory barrier), reads can be performed out of stale locally cached
copies, even if other processors used memory barriers to force their writes
into global memory.

</p><p>I've created <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/%7Epugh/java/memoryModel/AlphaReordering.html">a separate web page</a> with a discussion of how this can 
actually happen on an Alpha processor.

</p><h2>Is it worth the trouble?</h2>
<p>For most applications, the cost of simply making the <tt>getHelper()</tt>
method synchronized is not high. You should only consider this kind of
detailed optimizations if you know that it is causing a substantial
overhead for an application.
</p><p>Very often, more high level cleverness, such as using the builtin 
mergesort rather than handling exchange sort (see the SPECJVM DB benchmark)
will have much more impact.


</p><h2>Making it work for static singletons</h2>
<p>
If the singleton you are creating is static (i.e., there will only
be one <tt>Helper</tt> created), as opposed to a property of another
object (e.g., there will be one <tt>Helper</tt> for
each <tt>Foo</tt> object,
there is a simple and elegant solution.

</p><p>Just define the singleton as a static field in a separate class.
The semantics of Java guarantee that the field will not
be initialized until the field is referenced, and that any thread which
accesses the field will see all of the writes resulting from initializing 
that field.

</p><p>
<table border="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<pre>class HelperSingleton {
  static Helper singleton = new Helper();
  }
</pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table>



</p><h2>It will work for 32-bit primitive values</h2>
<p>Although the double-checked locking idiom cannot be used for references
to objects, it can work for 32-bit primitive values (e.g., int's or float's).
Note that it does not work for long's or double's, since unsynchronized reads/writes
of 64-bit primitives are not guaranteed to be atomic.

</p><p>
<table border="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<pre>// Correct Double-Checked Locking for 32-bit primitives
class Foo { 
  private int cachedHashCode = 0;
  public int hashCode() {
    int h = cachedHashCode;
    if (h == 0) 
    synchronized(this) {
      if (cachedHashCode != 0) return cachedHashCode;
      h = computeHashCode();
      cachedHashCode = h;
      }
    return h;
    }
  // other functions and members...
  }
</pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p>In fact, assuming that the computeHashCode function always
returned the same result and had no side effects (i.e., idempotent),
you could even get rid of all of the synchronization.

</p><p>
<table border="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<pre>// Lazy initialization 32-bit primitives
// Thread-safe if computeHashCode is idempotent
class Foo { 
  private int cachedHashCode = 0;
  public int hashCode() {
    int h = cachedHashCode;
    if (h == 0) {
      h = computeHashCode();
      cachedHashCode = h;
      }
    return h;
    }
  // other functions and members...
  }
</pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><h2><a name="explicitMemoryBarriers">Making it work with explicit memory barriers</a></h2>
<p>It is possible to make the double checked locking pattern work
if you have explicit memory barrier instructions. For example, if
you are programming in C++, you can use the code
from Doug Schmidt et al.'s book:

</p><p>
<table border="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<pre>// C++ implementation with explicit memory barriers
// Should work on any platform, including DEC Alphas
// From "Patterns for Concurrent and Distributed Objects",
// by Doug Schmidt
template &lt;class TYPE, class LOCK&gt; TYPE *
Singleton&lt;TYPE, LOCK&gt;::instance (void) {
    // First check
    TYPE* tmp = instance_;
    // Insert the CPU-specific memory barrier instruction
    // to synchronize the cache lines on multi-processor.
    asm ("memoryBarrier");
    if (tmp == 0) {
        // Ensure serialization (guard
        // constructor acquires lock_).
        Guard&lt;LOCK&gt; guard (lock_);
        // Double check.
        tmp = instance_;
        if (tmp == 0) {
                tmp = new TYPE;
                // Insert the CPU-specific memory barrier instruction
                // to synchronize the cache lines on multi-processor.
                asm ("memoryBarrier");
                instance_ = tmp;
        }
    return tmp;
    }
</pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><h2><a name="ThreadLocal">Fixing Double-Checked Locking using Thread Local Storage</a></h2>
<p>
Alexander Terekhov (TEREKHOV@de.ibm.com) 
came up clever suggestion for implementing
double checked locking using thread local storage. Each thread
keeps a thread local flag to determine whether
that thread has done the required synchronization.
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>
<pre>  class Foo {
	 /** If perThreadInstance.get() returns a non-null value, this thread
		has done synchronization needed to see initialization
		of helper */
         private final ThreadLocal perThreadInstance = new ThreadLocal();
         private Helper helper = null;
         public Helper getHelper() {
             if (perThreadInstance.get() == null) createHelper();
             return helper;
         }
         private final void createHelper() {
             synchronized(this) {
                 if (helper == null)
                     helper = new Helper();
             }
	     // Any non-null value would do as the argument here
             perThreadInstance.set(perThreadInstance);
         }
	}
</pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
</p><p>
The performance of this technique depends quite a bit on which JDK 
implementation
you have. In Sun's 1.2 implementation, ThreadLocal's were very slow. 
They are significantly faster in 1.3, and are expected to be faster 
still in 1.4. <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/%7Epugh/java/memoryModel/DCL-performance.html">Doug Lea analyzed the performance of some techniques for
implementing lazy initialization</a>.

</p><h2>Under the new Java Memory Model</h2>
<p>As of JDK5, there is <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/%7Epugh/java/memoryModel">a new Java Memory Model and Thread specification</a>.

</p><h3>Fixing Double-Checked Locking using Volatile</h3>

<p>JDK5 and later extends the semantics for volatile so that the
system will not allow a write of a volatile to be reordered with
respect to any previous read or write, and a read of a volatile cannot
be reordered with respect to any following read or write. See <a href="http://jeremymanson.blogspot.com/2008/05/double-checked-locking.html">
this entry in Jeremy Manson's blog</a> for more details.


</p><p>With this change, the Double-Checked Locking idiom can be made to
work by declaring the <tt>helper</tt> field to be volatile. This <em>does not
work</em> under JDK4 and earlier.

</p><p>
<table border="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<pre>// Works with acquire/release semantics for volatile
// Broken under current semantics for volatile
  class Foo {
        private volatile Helper helper = null;
        public Helper getHelper() {
            if (helper == null) {
                synchronized(this) {
                    if (helper == null)
                        helper = new Helper();
                }
            }
            return helper;
        }
    }
</pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><h3>Double-Checked Locking Immutable Objects</h3>
<p> If Helper is an immutable object, such that all of the fields of
Helper are final, then double-checked locking
will work without having to use volatile fields. 
The idea is that a reference to an immutable object (such as a
String or an Integer) should behave in much the same way as an int or float;
reading and writing references to immutable objects are atomic.
