<h3>What is a memory model, anyway? </h3>
</a>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">In multiprocessor systems, processors
generally have one or more layers of memory cache, which improves
performance both by speeding access to data (because the data is
closer to the processor) and reducing traffic on the shared memory bus
(because many memory operations can be satisfied by local caches.)
Memory caches can improve performance tremendously, but they present a
host of new challenges.  What, for example, happens when two processors
examine the same memory location at the same time? Under what
conditions will they see the same value? </p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">At the processor level, a memory model
defines necessary and sufficient conditions for knowing that writes to
memory by other processors are visible to the current processor, and
writes by the current processor are visible to other processors. Some
processors exhibit a strong memory model, where all processors see
exactly the same value for any given memory location at all
times. Other processors exhibit a weaker memory model, where special
instructions, called memory barriers, are required to flush or
invalidate the local processor cache in order to see writes made by
other processors or make writes by this processor visible to
others. These memory barriers are usually performed when lock and
unlock actions are taken; they are invisible to programmers in a high
level language.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">It can sometimes be easier to write
programs for strong memory models, because of the reduced need for
memory barriers. However, even on some of the strongest memory models,
memory barriers are often necessary; quite frequently their placement
is counterintuitive. Recent trends in processor design have encouraged
weaker memory models, because the relaxations they make for cache
consistency allow for greater scalability across multiple processors
and larger amounts of memory.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">The issue of when a write becomes
visible to another thread is compounded by the compiler's reordering
of code. For example, the compiler might decide that it is more
efficient to move a write operation later in the program; as long
as this code motion does not change the program's semantics, it is free to do
so.&nbsp; If a compiler defers an operation, another
thread will not see it until it is performed; this mirrors the effect
of caching.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Moreover, writes to memory can be moved
earlier in a program; in this case, other threads might see a write
before it actually "occurs" in the program.&nbsp; All of this
flexibility is by design -- by giving the compiler, runtime, or
hardware the flexibility to execute operations in the optimal order,
within the bounds of the memory model, we can achieve higher
performance.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">A simple example of this can be seen in the 
following code:</p>
<pre class="CodeBox"><code>Class Reordering {
  int x = 0, y = 0;
  public void writer() {
    x = 1;
    y = 2;
  }

  public void reader() {
    int r1 = y;
    int r2 = x;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Let's say that this code is executed in
two threads concurrently, and the read of y sees the value 2. Because
this write came after the write to x, the programmer might assume that
the read of x must see the value 1. However, the writes may have been
reordered. If this takes place, then the write to y could happen, the
reads of both variables could follow, and then the write to x could
take place. The result would be that r1 has the value 2, but r2 has
the value 0.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">The Java Memory Model describes what
behaviors are legal in multithreaded code, and how threads may
interact through memory. It describes the relationship between
variables in a program and the low-level details of storing and
retrieving them to and from memory or registers in a real computer
system. It does this in a way that can be implemented correctly using
a wide variety of hardware and a wide variety of compiler
optimizations.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Java includes several language
constructs, including volatile, final, and synchronized, which are
intended to help the programmer describe a program's concurrency
requirements to the compiler. The Java Memory Model defines the
behavior of volatile and synchronized, and, more importantly, ensures
that a correctly synchronized Java program runs correctly on all
processor architectures. </p> 

<a name="otherlanguages">
<h3>Do other languages, like C++, have a memory model?</h3>
</a>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Most other programming languages, such
as C and C++, were not designed with direct support for multithreading. 
The protections that these languages offer against the kinds
of reorderings that take place in compilers and architectures are
heavily dependent on the guarantees provided by the threading
libraries used (such as pthreads), the compiler used, and the platform
on which the code is run.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 

<a name="jsr133">
<h3>What is JSR 133 about?  </h3>
</a>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Since 1997, several serious flaws have been
discovered in the Java Memory Model as defined in Chapter 17 of the
Java Language Specification. These flaws allowed for confusing
behaviors (such as final fields being observed to change their value)
and undermined the compiler's ability to perform common
optimizations. </p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">The Java Memory Model was an ambitious
undertaking; it was the first time that a programming language
specification attempted to incorporate a memory model which could
provide consistent semantics for concurrency across a variety of
architectures. Unfortunately, defining a memory model which is both
consistent and intuitive proved far more difficult than expected. JSR
133 defines a new memory model for the Java language which fixes the
flaws of the earlier memory model. In order to do this, the
semantics of final and volatile needed to change. </p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">The full semantics are available at
<font color="#0000ff"><u><a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/users/pugh/java/memoryModel">http://www.cs.umd.edu/users/pugh/java/memoryModel</a></u></font>,
but the formal semantics are not for the timid. It is surprising, and
sobering, to discover how complicated seemingly simple concepts like
synchronization really are. Fortunately, you need not understand the
details of the formal semantics -- the goal of JSR 133 was to create a
set of formal semantics that provides an intuitive framework 
for how volatile, synchronized, and final work.
 </p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">The goals of JSR 133 include: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Preserving existing safety guarantees, like type-safety,
  and strengthening others.  For example,
  variable values may not be created "out of thin air": each
  value for a variable observed by some thread must be a value 
  that can reasonably be placed there by some thread. </li>
  <li>The semantics of correctly synchronized 
  programs should be as simple and intuitive as possible. </li>
  <li>The semantics of incompletely or incorrectly 
  synchronized programs should be defined so that potential security hazards are 
  minimized. </li>
  <li>Programmers should be able to reason confidently 
  about how multithreaded programs interact with memory.</li>
  <li>It should be possible to design correct, high 
  performance JVM implementations across a wide range of popular hardware 
  architectures. </li>
  <li>A new guarantee of <i> initialization safety</i> should 
  be provided. If an object is properly constructed (which means that references 
  to it do not escape during construction), then all threads which see a 
  reference to that object will also see the values for its final fields that 
  were set in the constructor, without the need for synchronization. </li>
  <li>There should be minimal impact on existing code. 
  </li>
</ul>

<a name="reordering">
<h3>What is meant by reordering?</h3>
</a>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">There are a number of cases in which
accesses to program variables (object instance fields, class static
fields, and array elements) may appear to execute in a different order
than was specified by the program. The compiler is free to take
liberties with the ordering of instructions in the name of
optimization. Processors may execute instructions out of order under
certain circumstances. Data may be moved between registers, processor
caches, and main memory in different order than specified by the
program.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">For example, if a thread writes to field
<tt>a</tt> and then to field <tt>b</tt>, and the value of <tt>b</tt>
does not depend on the value of <tt>a</tt>, then the compiler is free
to reorder these operations, and the cache is free to flush <tt>b</tt>
to main memory before <tt>a</tt>. There are a number of potential
sources of reordering, such as the compiler, the JIT, and the
cache.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">The compiler, runtime, and hardware are
supposed to conspire to create the illusion of as-if-serial semantics,
which means that in a single-threaded program, the program should not
be able to observe the effects of reorderings. However, reorderings
can come into play in incorrectly synchronized multithreaded programs,
where one thread is able to observe the effects of other threads, and
may be able to detect that variable accesses become visible to other
threads in a different order than executed or specified in the
program. </p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Most of the time, one thread doesn't care what the 
other is doing. But when it does, that's what synchronization is for. </p>

<a name="oldmm">
<h3>What was wrong with the old memory model?</h3>
</a>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">There were several serious problems with
the old memory model. It was difficult to understand, and therefore
widely violated. For example, the old model did not, in many cases,
allow the kinds of reorderings that took place in every JVM. This
confusion about the implications of the old model was what compelled
the formation of JSR-133.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">One widely held belief, for example, was
that if final fields were used, then synchronization between threads
was unnecessary to guarantee another thread would see the value of
the field. While this is a reasonable assumption and a sensible
behavior, and indeed how we would want things to work, under the old
memory model, it was simply not true. Nothing in the old memory model
treated final fields differently from any other field -- meaning
synchronization was the only way to ensure that all threads
see the value of a final field that was written by the
constructor. As a result, it was possible for a thread to see the
default value of the field, and then at some later time see its
constructed value. This means, for example, that immutable objects
like String can appear to change their value -- a disturbing prospect
indeed. </p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">The old memory model allowed for
volatile writes to be reordered with nonvolatile reads and writes,
which was not consistent with most developers intuitions about
volatile and therefore caused confusion. </p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Finally, as we shall see, programmers'
intuitions about what can occur when their programs are incorrectly
synchronized are often mistaken. One of the goals of JSR-133 is to
call attention to this fact.</p> 

<a name="incorrectlySync">
<h3>What do you mean by “incorrectly synchronized”?</h3>
</a>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Incorrectly synchronized code can mean
different things to different people. When we talk about incorrectly
synchronized code in the context of the Java Memory Model, we mean any
code where</p>

<ol>
<li> there is a write of a variable by one thread, </li>
<li> there is a read of the same variable by another thread and </li>
<li> the write and read are not ordered by synchronization </li>
</ol>


<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">When these rules are violated, we say we have a 
<i>data race</i> on that variable. A program with a data race is an
incorrectly synchronized program.</p>

<a name="synchronization">
<h3>What does synchronization do?</h3>
</a>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Synchronization has several aspects. The
most well-understood is mutual exclusion -- only one thread can hold a
monitor at once, so synchronizing on a monitor means that once one
thread enters a synchronized block protected by a monitor, no other
thread can enter a block protected by that monitor until the first
thread exits the synchronized block. </p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">But there is more to synchronization
than mutual exclusion. Synchronization ensures that memory writes by a
thread before or during a synchronized block are made visible in a
predictable manner to other threads which synchronize on the same
monitor. After we exit a synchronized block, we <b>release </b>the
monitor, which has the effect of flushing the cache to main memory, so
that writes made by this thread can be visible to other threads.
Before we can enter a synchronized block, we <b>acquire</b> the
monitor, which has the effect of invalidating the local processor
cache so that variables will be reloaded from main memory.
We will then be able to see all of the writes made visible by the previous
release.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Discussing this in terms of caches, it
may sound as if these issues only affect multiprocessor
machines. However, the reordering effects can be easily seen on a
single processor. It is not possible, for example, for the compiler to
move your code before an acquire or after a release. When we say that
acquires and releases act on caches, we are using shorthand for a
number of possible effects. </p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">The new memory model semantics create a
partial ordering on memory operations (read field, write field, lock,
unlock) and other thread operations (start and join), where some
actions are said to <i>happen before</i> other operations. When one
action happens before another, the first is guaranteed to be
ordered before and visible to the second. The rules of this ordering
are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each action in a thread happens before every 
  action in that thread that comes later in the program's order.</li>
  <li>An unlock on a monitor happens before every 
  subsequent lock on <b>that same</b> monitor.</li>
  <li>A write to a volatile field happens before every 
  subsequent read of <b>that same</b> volatile.</li>
  <li>A call to <tt>start()</tt> on a thread happens 
  before any actions in the started thread.</li>
  <li>All actions in a thread happen before any other 
  thread successfully returns from a <tt>join() </tt>on that thread.</li>
</ul>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">This means that any memory operations
which were visible to a thread before exiting a synchronized block are
visible to any thread after it enters a synchronized block protected
by the same monitor, since all the memory operations happen before the
release, and the release happens before the acquire. </p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Another implication is that the
following pattern, which some people use to force a memory barrier,
doesn't work: </p>

<pre class="CodeBox"><code>synchronized (new Object()) {}</code></pre>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">This is actually a no-op, and your
compiler can remove it entirely, because the compiler knows that no
other thread will synchronize on the same monitor. You have to set up
a happens-before relationship for one thread to see the results of
another.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><b>Important Note:</b> Note that it is
important for both threads to synchronize on the same monitor in order
to set up the happens-before relationship properly. It is not the case
that everything visible to thread A when it synchronizes on object X
becomes visible to thread B after it synchronizes on object Y. The
release and acquire have to "match" (i.e., be performed on the same
monitor) to have the right semantics. Otherwise, the code has a data
race.</p>

<a name="finalWrong">
<h3>How can final fields appear to change their values?  </h3>
</a>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">One of the best examples of how final
fields' values can be seen to change involves one particular
implementation of the <tt>String</tt> class.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">A <tt>String</tt> can be implemented as an object
with three fields -- a character array, an offset into that array, and
a length. The rationale for implementing <tt>String</tt> this way, instead of
having only the character array, is that it lets multiple <tt>String</tt> and
<tt>StringBuffer</tt> objects share the same character array and avoid
additional object allocation and copying. So, for example, the method
<tt>String.substring()</tt> can be implemented by creating a new string which
shares the same character array with the original <tt>String</tt> and merely
differs in the length and offset fields. For a <tt>String</tt>, these fields
are all final fields. </p>

<pre class="CodeBox"><code>String s1 = "/usr/tmp";
String s2 = s1.substring(4); 
</code></pre>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">The string <tt>s2</tt> will have an offset of 4
and a length of 4. But, under the old model, it was possible for
another thread to see the offset as having the default value of 0, and
then later see the correct value of 4, it will appear as if the string
"/usr" changes to "/tmp". </p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">The original Java Memory Model allowed
this behavior; several JVMs have exhibited this behavior. The new Java
Memory Model makes this illegal.</p>

<a name="finalRight">
<h3>How do final fields work under the new JMM? </h3>
</a>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">The values for an object's final fields
are set in its constructor. Assuming the object is constructed
"correctly", once an object is constructed, the 
values assigned to the final fields in the constructor will be
visible to all other threads without synchronization. In addition, the
visible values for any other object or array referenced by those final
fields will be at least as up-to-date as the final fields. </p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">What does it mean for an object to be
properly constructed? It simply means that no reference to the object
being constructed is allowed to "escape" during
construction. (See <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp0618.html">Safe
Construction Techniques</a> for examples.)&nbsp; In other words, do
not place a reference to the object being constructed anywhere where
another thread might be able to see it; do not assign it to a static
field, do not register it as a listener with any other object, and so
on.  These tasks should be done after the constructor completes, not
in the constructor. </p>

<pre class="CodeBox"><code>class FinalFieldExample {
  final int x;
  int y;
  static FinalFieldExample f;
  public FinalFieldExample() {
    x = 3;
    y = 4;
  }

  static void writer() {
    f = new FinalFieldExample();
  }

  static void reader() {
    if (f != null) {
      int i = f.x;
      int j = f.y;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">The class above is an example of how
final fields should be used. A thread executing <tt>reader</tt> is
guaranteed to see the value 3 for <tt>f.x</tt>, because it is
final. It is not guaranteed to see the value 4 for <tt>y</tt>, because
it is not final. If <tt>FinalFieldExample</tt>'s constructor looked
like this: </p>

<pre class="CodeBox"><code>public FinalFieldExample() { // bad!
  x = 3;
  y = 4;
  // bad construction - allowing this to escape
  global.obj = this;
}
</code></pre>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">then threads that read the reference to
<tt>this </tt>from <tt>global.obj</tt> are <b>not</b> guaranteed to
see 3 for <tt>x</tt>.
</p>

<p>
The ability to see the correctly constructed value for the field is
nice, but if the field itself is a reference, then you also want your
code to see the up to date values for the object (or array) to which
it points.  If your field is a final field, this is also guaranteed.
So, you can have a final pointer to an array and not have to worry
about other threads seeing the correct values for the array reference,
but incorrect values for the contents of the array.  Again, by
"correct" here, we mean "up to date as of the end of the object's
constructor", not "the latest value available".
</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">
Now, having said all of this, if, after a thread constructs an
immutable object (that is, an object that only contains final fields),
you want to ensure that it is seen correctly by all of the other
thread, you <b>still</b> typically need to use synchronization.  There is no
other way to ensure, for example, that the reference to the immutable
object will be seen by the second thread.  The guarantees the program
gets from final fields should be carefully tempered with a deep and
careful understanding of how concurrency is managed in your code.
</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">There is no defined behavior if you want
to use JNI to change final fields. </p>

<a name="volatile">
<h3>What does volatile do? </h3>
</a>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Volatile fields are special fields which
are used for communicating state between threads. Each read of a
volatile will see the last write to that volatile by any thread; in
effect, they are designated by the programmer as fields for which it
is never acceptable to see a "stale" value as a result of caching or
reordering. The compiler and runtime are prohibited from allocating
them in registers. They must also ensure that after they are written,
they are flushed out of the cache to main memory, so they can
immediately become visible to other threads. Similarly, before a
volatile field is read, the cache must be invalidated so that the
value in main memory, not the local processor cache, is the one
seen. There are also additional restrictions on reordering accesses to
volatile variables. </p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Under the old memory model, accesses to
volatile variables could not be reordered with each other, but they
could be reordered with nonvolatile variable accesses. This undermined
the usefulness of volatile fields as a means of signaling conditions
from one thread to another. </p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Under the new memory model, it is still
true that volatile variables cannot be reordered with each other.  The
difference is that it is now no longer so easy to reorder normal field
accesses around them.  Writing 
to a volatile field has the same memory effect as a monitor release,
and reading from a volatile field has the same memory effect as a monitor
acquire. In effect, because the new memory model places stricter
constraints on reordering of volatile field accesses with other field
accesses, volatile or not, anything that was visible to thread A when
it writes to volatile field <tt>f</tt> becomes visible to thread B when it
reads <tt>f</tt>. </p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Here is a simple example of how volatile
fields can be used:</p>

<pre class="CodeBox"><code>class VolatileExample {
  int x = 0;
  volatile boolean v = false;
  public void writer() {
    x = 42;
    v = true;
  }

  public void reader() {
    if (v == true) {
      //uses x - guaranteed to see 42.
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Assume that one thread is calling
<tt>writer</tt>, and another is calling <tt>reader</tt>. The write to
<tt>v</tt> in <tt>writer</tt> releases the write to <tt>x</tt> to
memory, and the read of <tt>v</tt> acquires that value from memory.
Thus, if the reader sees the value <tt> true</tt> for v, it is also
guaranteed to see the write to 42 that happened before it. This would
not have been true under the old memory model.&nbsp; If <tt>v</tt> were not
volatile, then the compiler could reorder the writes in
<tt>writer</tt>, and <tt>reader</tt>'s read of <tt>x</tt> might see 0.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Effectively, the semantics of volatile
have been strengthened substantially, almost to the level of
synchronization. Each read or write of a volatile field acts like
"half" a synchronization, for purposes of visibility. </p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><b>Important Note:</b> Note that it is
important for both threads to access the same volatile variable in
order to properly set up the happens-before relationship. It is not
the case that everything visible to thread A when it writes volatile
field <tt>f</tt> becomes visible to thread B after it reads volatile field
<tt>g</tt>. The release and acquire have to "match" (i.e., be performed on the
same volatile field) to have the right semantics. </p> 

<a name="dcl">
<h3>Does the new memory model fix the "double-checked locking"
problem?</h3>
</a>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">The (infamous) double-checked locking
idiom (also called the multithreaded singleton pattern) is a trick
designed to support lazy initialization while avoiding the overhead of
synchronization. In very early JVMs, synchronization was slow, and
developers were eager to remove it -- perhaps too eager. The
double-checked locking idiom looks like this:</p>

<pre class="CodeBox"><code>// double-checked-locking - don't do this!

private static Something instance = null;

public Something getInstance() {
  if (instance == null) {
    synchronized (this) {
      if (instance == null)
        instance = new Something();
    }
  }
  return instance;
}
</code></pre>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">This looks awfully clever -- the
synchronization is avoided on the common code path. There's only one
problem with it -- <b>it doesn't work</b>. Why not? The most obvious
reason is that the writes which initialize <tt>instance</tt> and the
write to the <tt>instance</tt> field can be reordered by the compiler
or the cache, which would have the effect of returning what appears to
be a partially constructed <tt>Something</tt>. The result would be
that we read an uninitialized object. There are lots of other reasons
why this is wrong, and why algorithmic corrections to it are
wrong. There is no way to fix it using the old Java memory model. More
in-depth information can be found at <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/jw-02-2001/jw-0209-double.html">Double-checked
locking: Clever, but broken</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/%7Epugh/java/memoryModel/DoubleCheckedLocking.html">The
"Double Checked Locking is broken" declaration</a></p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Many people assumed that the use of the
<tt>volatile </tt>keyword would eliminate the problems that arise when
trying to use the double-checked-locking pattern. In JVMs prior to
1.5, <tt>volatile</tt> would not ensure that it worked (your mileage
may vary). Under the new memory model, making the <tt>instance</tt>
field volatile will "fix" the problems with double-checked
locking, because then there will be a happens-before relationship
between the initialization of the <tt>Something</tt> by the
constructing thread and the return of its value by the thread that
reads it.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><strike>
However, for fans of double-checked locking (and we really hope there are 
none left), the news is still not good. The whole point of double-checked 
locking was to avoid the performance overhead of synchronization. Not only 
has brief synchronization gotten a LOT less expensive since the Java 1.0 
days, but under the new memory model, the performance cost of using 
volatile goes up, almost to the level of the cost of synchronization. So 
there's still no good reason to use double-checked-locking. </strike><i> 
Redacted -- volatiles are cheap on most platforms. </i></p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Instead, use the Initialization On
Demand Holder idiom, which is thread-safe and a lot easier to
understand:</p>

<pre class="CodeBox"><code>private static class LazySomethingHolder {
  public static Something something = new Something();
}

public static Something getInstance() {
  return LazySomethingHolder.something;
}
</code></pre>

This code is guaranteed to be correct because of the initialization
guarantees for static fields; if a field is set in a static
initializer, it is guaranteed to be made visible, correctly, to any thread that
accesses that class.

<h3>Why should I care?</h3>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Why should you care? Concurrency bugs
are very difficult to debug. They often don't appear in testing,
waiting instead until your program is run under heavy load, and are
hard to reproduce and trap. You are much better off spending the extra
effort ahead of time to ensure that your program is properly
synchronized; while this is not easy, it's a lot easier than trying to
debug a badly synchronized application. </p>
