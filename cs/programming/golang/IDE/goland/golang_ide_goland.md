## Debug



```
please go to "Help | Debug Log Settings..." and add the following line "#com.goide.dlv.DlvVm" (please preserve the "#" symbol).
Then go run the debug session as before, let the issue be encountered, then go to "Help | Debug Log Settings..." and remove that line, then go to "Help | Compress Logs and Show in...", take the archive and publish it here.
You can set the visibility to "jetbrains-team" only so that only we can see the contents of the archive.
